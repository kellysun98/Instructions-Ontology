Personal Care and Style,"[""1. Wash your hair before you cut it. Your hair will be easier to work with if it's clean and snarl-free. Get your hair wet under running water and use shampoo and conditioner, rinsing both out after you've worked them through your hair."", ""2. Detangle your hair with a comb. Run the comb through your hair and work out any knots with the comb or with your fingers. Ridding your hair of tangles beforehand will result in a cleaner, more even cut.\nIf your hair dries out while you comb it, spritz it with water until it's damp again.\nUse a detangling product or a natural remedy to tackle particularly stubborn snarls."", ""3. Towel dry your hair. The best time to cut your hair is when it's damp, but not soaking wet. If your hair's still dripping, dry it off with a towel. Comb your hair again to get rid of any tangles made from drying it.\nIf you cut your hair while it's still wet, it may not lay the same way it does while it's dry."", ""4. Find a comfortable place to cut your hair. Cutting your hair can take up to several hours, especially if you've never done it before. Choose a spot where you can sit down and work without worrying about making a mess.\nThe best place to cut hair is the bathroom, where you'll have access to running water and a mirror."", '5. Position yourself near a mirror. You’ll want to be able to see what you’re doing as much as possible. A large-sized mirror on your bathroom wall or medicine cabinet will help you see what you’re cutting in front or on the sides.\nIf possible, set up a second mirror so you can see the back of your head, either hanging from the wall opposite or as a hand mirror held by someone else.', '6. Section your hair into parts. Run the comb back through your hair right about where your head curves, then comb the hair between the part and the ear down. Do this on both sides to section off both sides of your head.\nIf your hair is long enough, you can use clips to hold the top section away from your sides.', ""1. Use clippers on a small guard setting to cut the back and sides. Clippers are the best for the back and sides for beginners or those who want a basic haircut. Set your clippers' guard, which controls how much hair you can cut, to 1 or 2 to make conservative cuts while you work."", ""2. Cut one side of the head at a time. Use a low clipper guard around sides and, with the blade's edge, trim from the bottom of the sides to the top. Tilt the clipper blade at an angle as you work to create an even fade with the rest of your hair. Then, repeat this process on the other side of your head before moving to the back, making sure to transition between lengths at the same point on both sides.\nGoing against your hair's grain will result in a cleaner cut.\nSome clippers come with ear tapers, which help you cut above and around your ears. Use these, if available, to make cleaner cuts around the ears."", ""3. Move to the back of your head. After cutting your sides, trim the back of your head from the bottom to the top as you did with the sides. To make sure you're cutting evenly, have a friend hold up a mirror or position a mirror behind you so you can check your progress as you cut.\nUse the same guard length on the back and sides of your hair when performing basic, at-home haircuts."", '4. Go over the lower half with a shorter setting. To even out fades between cuts, go over the lower half of your hair with your clippers set to a shorter setting. Lift your hair as you approach your temples and earlobes.\nWork slowly while using clippers to ensure as even of a fade as possible.', ""1. Use styling scissors on the top of your head. Using styling scissors instead of clippers will help you make more precise cuts and give your hair more texture. You can buy styling scissors online or at most hair care stores.\nDo not use household scissors to cut your hair, as they aren't sharp enough to properly cut hair so you're more likely to make mistakes."", ""2. Trim the top in sections. Use your fingers or a comb to raise the hair from the top of your head. Work slowly and carefully in 1/4 in (about 6 mm) sections. These should be parallel to the front of your hairline. As you trim, pull a little of the previously cut section into the new section as a traveling guideline.\nCuts to the hair on top of your head are more noticeable than cuts to the hair on the sides of your head. Always start with conservative cuts. Remember, you can always cut more, but you can't add back lost length.\nWhen you've finished with this area, you can check your guideline by holding up a section of hair that is perpendicular to your hairline. Your hair should be the same length across the entirety of this section.\nBe gentle on your head while cutting the crown, which is usually more tender than the rest of the head."", '3. Trim your bangs, if applicable, with styling scissors. If you have bangs, section it into small parts. Brush your comb through each section the amount you want to cut pokes through the end and trim it off with your scissors.', ""1. Even out the sides. Use a mirror to check your sides and make sure they are even. Comb your hair straight out and grab a horizontal section from about the same point on each side of your head. Check to see if these sections are the same length. If they are not, trim away any extra length and bumps, taking off small amounts at a time. Remember, it's always easier to cut a little and touch up more later."", '2. Cut your sideburns to your desired length. You can trim your sideburns with either a safety razor or with your clippers. If you want long sideburns, trim from the bottom of your ears. If shorter, you can use the depression below your cheekbone to determine where the bottoms of your sideburns should be.\nPlace your fingers underneath each sideburn to check that they’re even after trimming.', '3. Blend your top with your sides. Comb the top of your hair down toward your sides. Holding your sheers vertically, cut into the corners to remove bulk.', '4. Taper your neckline. Use your clippers or a beard trimmer to cut the hair growing on the nape of your neck. Start with a grazing cut at the top of the neckline, then cut progressively closer as you work toward the nape of the neck.\nUse a handheld mirror to examine your neckline after tapering it to make sure it looks neat and even.', ""5. Style your hair immediately after cutting it. After cutting your hair, rinse it in the shower to remove any strays. Towel dry, then, part it with a comb and style it as you usually would. Decide whether you're happy with your new style and, if not, either cut it again or visit a hairstylist to make extensive changes.\nIf you notice any mistakes or uneven areas while styling, trim these areas again as needed.""]"
Philosophy and Religion,"['1. Arrange to wake up after midnight. After praying the Isha prayer and before going to sleep, make arrangements to wake up during the night before the Fajr prayer (for instance, you may want to set an alarm clock or have a family member agree to wake you). Though the Tahajjud can be prayed at any part of the night, if possible, it is best to pray it after midnight, especially during the last third of the night. The time two-thirds of the way between Isha and Fajr is a good time for Tahajjud. This is because Allah descends to the lowest heaven during the last third of the night, asking, ""Who is asking me, so I can give to him? Who is calling upon me, so I can answer him? Who is seeking my forgiveness, so I can forgive him?\'"" \nIf you make an honest effort to wake up and perform the Tahajjud but accidentally sleep through the night, don\'t feel guilty. According to ahadeeth, Allah records your genuine intention to perform the Tahajjud and grants you sleep as an act of mercy. You will be rewarded as if your intention had been fulfilled. However, if you make a conscious decision to abandon your intention to pray Tahajjud without good reason, for example through laziness, then it may not be overlooked. t', ""2. Wake up and perform Wudu. Wake up during the night at the time you've chosen. Once you wake, perform Wudu, the ritual ablution Muslims use to cleanse themselves before they pray or handle the Holy Quran. Traditionally, performing Wudu means using clean water to wash oneself in the following four ways:\nWashing the face\nWashing the arms and hands up to and including the elbows\nWiping the head (Masah)\n\nWashing the feet up to the ankles\nNote that many Muslims (including the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) also choose to wash their mouth and teeth with a miswak before the Tahajjud.\nIf you have discharged mani earlier in the night, whether during sexual intercourse or a wet dream, then the Ghusl full-body ritual cleansing must be performed."", ""3. Go somewhere clean, quiet, and dignified to conduct your prayer. This is done because Allah's names are pure, so, whenever possible, Muslims are encouraged to speak of Him in clean, holy places as a form of reverence. Wearing your normal prayer clothes, sit down on a prayer mat and face the Holy Kabah in Mecca as you would for your obligatory prayers.\nTo be clear, you don't need to be anywhere special, like a mosque or a lavishly-decorated room in your house, to pray the Tahajjud. All that's needed is a spot that's clean which can even be in your room."", '4. Remove all worldly worries from your heart. At the time for prayer, calmly focus and reflect on the glory of your Lord. Do not worry about fleeting worldly problems that are ultimately meaningless in comparison to His infinite wisdom and mercy. Calm yourself and forget your worldly problems, hopes, and fears. Ignore any negative, distracting thoughts or feelings. Close your eyes and focus your attention on your heart as you begin to achieve a heightened state of spiritual awareness.', ""1. Make your intention to pray known. As you start your prayer, make a definitive mental declaration to yourself that you are about to perform the Tahajjud. Decide that you are going to complete the Tahajjud in the specific way you have chosen, including how many rakats and which surahs you will recite. Also decide why you are saying the Tahajjud — for instance, to glorify Allah, thank Allah or ask for His forgiveness. You don't have to make this declaration out loud — Allah knows your thoughts, so your intentions will be clear to him as long as they are clear to you.\nThe Tahajjud is typically performed by repeating multiple rakats (cycles) of Salah, the ritual that Muslims use for their required daily prayer. For the Tahajjud, the rakats are usually performed in pairs, so you'll also want to decide exactly how many rakats you intend to perform at this time. See below for more information."", '2. Perform two rakats. To begin your Tahajjud, start by performing two rakats (cycles) of Salah. Salah begins by standing and reciting verses from the Holy Quran. Then, the person praying continues by bowing low with his hands on his knees, then  prostrating on the ground with his forehead, nose, and palms on the floor and his elbows raised, sitting on his knees with his feet folded under him, and finally standing and reciting ""Allahu Akbar."" This description of Salah is a generalization — if you\'re not sure how to perform Salah properly, learn this fundamental Muslim skill before attempting the Tahajjud.\nEmulate the practices of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) who used to recite the following surahs after each rakat in Tahajjud:After reciting the Al-Fatihah the first rakat, recite the surah ""Al-Kafirun"".\nAfter reciting the Al-Fatihah for the second rakat, recite the surah ""Al-Ikhlas"".', ""3. Repeat rakats as you wish. Generally, two rakats is seen as the minimum necessary for a proper Tahajjud. However, it's possible to repeat as many more as you wish. For instance, according to the Hadiths, the Prophet Muhammad frequently prayed up to thirteen rakats. Tahajjud rakats are performed in pairs and eight rakats is seen as a good number by many Muslims. In other words, most people will say two, four, six, or eight rakats, though more is not discouraged.\nIf you are able to, then reciting long surahs such as Al-Baqarah, An-Nisā’ or Al-‘Imran are highly commended, even if you can manage them only from time to time.\nFollowing in the example of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), if you notice dawn approaching while you say your Tahajjud, you may end by performing one rakat as Witr (an optional pre-dawn prayer said before the required Fajr)."", ""4. Add your own prayers (dua) after the rakats. After you've completed the number of rakats you set out to pray, you may add your own dua as long as they're sincere, respectful, and done in complete devotion to Allah. These may be offered in extended prostration in your own words and language. You may want to offer additional thanks and praise to Allah, pray for strength and guidance, or make a special request for help. For instance, you may ask for blessings for a friend who is suffering through difficult times or help with your own worship or simply spend a few moments thanking Allah for a blessing that He granted you the previous day. Prayers should be offered with humbleness, fear, hope and patience. This is an ideal time to ask for forgiveness for your mistakes and sins as Allah is especially open to our repentance at night according to many ahadeeth.\nAcknowledge each of your wrongdoings, however big or small - you may feel that some are insignificant, but Allah may still decide that a penalty is due. Sincerely promise not to repeat your sins and ask Allah for forgiveness.\nUse the fear of displeasing Allah to drive yourself to become a better Muslim.\nNever lose hope of Allah's mercy for the Qur'an tells us more than 70 times that Allah is the Most Forgiving.\nAny prayer you offer will be heard, and, if Allah wills, your prayer will be answered in kind."", ""5. Go back to bed, if you become too tired to complete the Tahajjud. Because the Tahajjud interrupts your normal sleep, it's not unlikely that you may be somewhat tired when you attempt the prayer. If, however, you're so tired that you find yourself forgetting what you're saying as you recite your prayers or you doze off in the middle of your Tahajjud, don't attempt to complete the prayer. In this case, according to several ahadeeth, Allah notes your sincere willingness to complete the Tahajjud. You may go back to sleep without any need to be embarrassed or ashamed, but try to better prepare yourself next time, perhaps by going to bed earlier."", ""1. Read scriptural passages about Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)'s observance of the Tahajjud. To gain a greater understanding of the unique importance of the Tahajjud prayer, you may want to consult any of the numerous references to the prayer in Islamic scripture. Most notably, the Tahajjud is mentioned in the Quran and discussed at great length in numerous ahadeeth. However, it is also discussed in the work of Islamic scholars throughout the history of the religion.\nTo start, try reading Book 21 (Prayer at Night) from Sahih Bukhari. No less than 70 ahadeeth in this book describe the habits the Prophet (pbuh) regarding the Tahajjud, which gives an indication of its significance in the life of a good Muslim. Commentary on the Tahajjud is also offered at multiple points in the Quran, including Surat 17:79 and Surat 39:9."", ""2. Consider saying the Tahajjud with your family. Muslim families are encouraged to pray the Tahajjud in communion with each other because both Muhammad (pbuh) and his wife Aisha recommended that husbands and wives should say the Tahajjud together. Performing the Tahajjud as a family allows you to come closer to each other in devotion to Allah and to show solidarity in your worship.\nIf you're interested in trying this, ask your spouse and/or children to join you before the first night you plan to say the Tahajjud together, then, if they need your help to do so, wake them up and celebrate Allah's infinite greatness and mercy in quiet prayer together. Children over the age of ten should be gently encouraged to develop the habit of praying Tahajjud when they are ready, but if it is too difficult for them to wake in the night then no blame should be apportioned and they should not be admonished, as long as they are up for Fajr and complete all their obligatory prayers correctly.\nEncourage your children by reminding them of the rewards that are available for completing voluntary acts of worship like Tahajjud, and warn them of the consequences of not making the sacrifices that Allah expects and deserves.\nGenerally, families that pray the Tahajjud together make exceptions for members that need their sleep, like small children, the sick, and the elderly."", ""3. Emulate the practices of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). All Muslims are encouraged to live in emulation of the life of Muhammad (pbuh), Allah's Messenger and the Seal of the Prophets. If you're looking for guidance in performing the Tahajjud, you may want to study the ways Muhammad (pbuh) performed the Tahajjud and try to work these habits into your daily life. By striving to emulate the Prophet (pbuh)'s Tahajjud practices, Muslims can work towards the perfect ideal represented by him and, in doing so, become closer to Allah.\nAs noted above, Book 21 from Sahih Bukhari is a great place to start if you're looking for information on Muhammad (pbuh)'s Tahajjud habits and practices."", ""4. Make the Tahajjud part of your routine. As an optional prayer, the Tahajjud certainly isn't something that any Muslim should feel compelled to do and there is no punishment for missing it. However, many Muslims choose to practice the Tahajjud on a regular basis (if not every night) when they are able. Like all forms of prayer, saying the Tahajjud brings you closer to Allah. In addition, the Tahajjud is often associated with Allah's gifts of forgiveness and redemption, making it a great way to seek correction for each day's minor failures, sins and imperfect actions.\nRemember that Allah appreciates regular acts of worship, so if you start praying Tahajjud, try not to give it up. If you're interested in making the Tahajjud a regular part of your life, you may want to try setting a recurring alarm to wake you up during the night or even having a predetermined area in your house for performing this prayer.\nIf you are unable to commit to praying Tahajjud every single night, then try build up slowly by establishing the habit of saying just two or four rakats two or three times a week, whatever you can manage, with the aim of building up over time.""]"
Personal Care and Style,"['1. Work outside or in a well-ventilated area. The fumes from bleach are extremely strong and they can be dangerous, so make sure you set up your project in an area with plenty of fresh air. If you can, try to work outside. If that’s not an option, choose a large room and open a window or turn on a fan.', '2. Protect your hands with heavy rubber gloves. Bleach is a strong chemical. Even when it’s diluted it can cause chemical burns on your skin. Be sure to wear heavy rubber gloves (like the kind used for cleaning) to protect your skin while you’re tie dyeing your clothes with bleach. You can get these wherever cleaning supplies are sold.', '3. Choose cotton clothing in a dark color. Black is the best color for tie dyeing with bleach because you will get the best contrast, but you can use any color as long as it’s dark enough to produce an effect. Experiment with different colors to find what you like!', '4. Avoid garments made from delicate or synthetic fabrics. Bleach won’t affect synthetic materials like polyester because they are designed to be colorfast. In addition, bleach can damage more delicate fabrics such as silk.', '5. Lay down old towels or a drop cloth. If you’re working inside, you’ll need to protect your work surface from bleach, so cover it with a drop cloth or old towels that can get messed up. If you’re using an absorbent material like a towel, be sure it doesn’t get soaked or the bleach will seep through and ruin whatever’s beneath it.\nIf you’re working outside, you’ll want to have something laid on the ground to protect your garment from getting dirty during the tie dyeing process.', '1. Twist your garment to create a pattern and secure it with rubber bands. Space the rubber bands several inches apart. The parts of your garment that are rubber-banded will stay the original color, while the exposed fabric will turn white when you bleach it.\nYou can get creative with your designs or you can just bunch up the fabric and put rubber bands on it to get a random and totally unique look.\nAs closely tied as the rubber band or the string you use will be, the tenser removing it will become. If you want, instead or removing, you can cut off the rubber bands carefully, in the end.', '2. Twirl the garment to create a spiral pattern. To create a traditional spiral tie-dye pattern, hold your garment with 2 fingers and twirl it so it twists tightly. Keep twirling until the entire garment is twisted into a tight knot. Secure the twirl with several rubber bands, then apply your bleach mixture. You can use a string to tie it up too. The tighter the spirals are secured, the better the distinction between darker and lighter areas will be formed.', ""3. Create several patterns on the same garment with knots. If you want to create a haphazard tie-dye, try using rubber bands to create several tight, small knots on the garment. Bunch these all together and secure with more rubber bands, then apply the bleach. Secure them tightly so the bleach doesn't seep through the knots."", '4. Relocate the rubber bands and re-spray for a multi-hue effect. If you want to create a layered look, twist up your garment and apply rubber bands, then apply bleach to your fabric and let it sit for about 5-6 minutes. Take all of the rubber bands off your garment, twist your garment again, put the rubber bands back on, and re-spray the garment with the bleach mixture. Leave the second batch on for the 8-10 minutes, then rinse.', '5. Create an ombre effect on your garment by dipping it in a bleach mixture. After you’ve tie-dyed your garment, you can make a cool faded effect by dip-dyeing the fabric. In a large bucket, dilute another mixture of 1/2 bleach and 1/2 water. Dip the bottom few inches of your garment in the bucket and leave it for 5-10 minutes to create an ombre effect.', '1. Fill a spray or squeeze bottle with a mixture of 1/2 bleach and 1/2 water. You can get a bottle for your project at almost any store which sells cleaning supplies. You can use either a spray bottle or a squeeze bottle. A squeeze bottle may produce a slightly more precise effect than a spray bottle, but the results will be similar with either one.', '2. Apply the bleach mixture to the exposed fabric of the garment. Spray or squeeze the bleach mixture from your bottle onto your garment. You can vary the amount of bleach that you use depending on how intense you want the color change to be. A heavier application of bleach will cause the fabric to lighten more, and you can create different looks by applying the bleach only to some areas and not to others.', '3. Allow the bleach to sit on the fabric for 8-10 minutes. You should be able to see the bleach changing the color of the garment within about 2 minutes, but it will take 8-10 minutes for the bleach to really seep into the fabric. If you leave it on much longer the bleach could damage your garment.', '4. Wash the garment in a mild detergent when the time is up. Remove all the rubber bands. You want to wash your garment right away to stop the chemical bleaching process. You can either put your clothing in the washing machine with a mild detergent or you can hand wash it in your sink or bathtub.\nIf you hand wash your garment, make sure to leave on your gloves until you’ve finished rinsing it so you don’t come into contact with any bleach.\nHave your bathtub rinsed well if you washed in it.', '5. Hang your garment to air-dry or place it in the dryer. Once your garment is thoroughly rinsed, you can either air-dry it or put it in the dryer, depending on how you normally prefer to dry your clothes. After it’s dry, it’s ready to wear, so put it on and enjoy your new style!']"
Home and Garden,"[""1. Keep the toilet from overflowing. If your toilet doesn't flush properly after one flush, don't flush again. This will cause more water to be pumped into the toilet bowl. Instead, take the lid off of the toilet tank and close the toilet flapper. Closing the flapper will keep more water from entering the bowl.\nThe flapper looks like a circular drain stopper attached to a chain.\nThe water in the tank isn't dirty, so it's fine to stick your hand inside to close the flapper."", '2. Prepare the bathroom. In case splashing occurs, place newspapers or paper towels on the floor to soak up liquid. The paper will make for easier cleanup later. You should also turn on the ventilation fan or open a window to rid the area of foul odors.\nIf the clog is serious, put on a pair of rubber gloves. Toilets are unsanitary, but a good pair of rubber cleaning gloves will protect you from any germs within. Choose gloves that reach up to your elbows.\nYou may also want to put on an old set of clothing, just in case things get messy.', ""3. See if you can clear the obstruction. If you can see the cause of the clog, reach in and remove it from the toilet if possible. If you can't clear it with your hands, but you know there's an object (such as a child's toy) causing the clog, skip the plunging and go straight to another method."", '4. Use a high quality plunger. It is important to use a large heavy-duty rubber plunger, either the ball-shaped type or one with a fold-out rubber flange on the bottom which forms a seal. Do not use the small cheap suction-cup type of plunger. These will often not work.\nRun the plunger under hot water before using it. This will soften it up, which will help with create a seal.', ""5. Insert the plunger into the bowl. Make sure the plunger completely covers the hole. The plunger should be submerged in water to be effective. It is important to be pushing and pulling water through the opening, not air. Add water from the sink to the bowl if necessary.\nPump the plunger over the hole. Start slowly at first, since the first plunge will push air into the bowl. Push down, then pull up sharply to disturb the clog and loosen it. Continue vigorously pushing and pulling until the water begins to drain. It may take 15 to 20 cycles before the toilet unclogs. Be patient. As long as you're sure there's no hard object, plunging alone often suffices. It might not work immediately but will often work after a few repeated efforts and flushings, with each effort consisting of dozens of plunge cycles."", '6. Flush the toilet to check the drainage. If the plunging eventually drains the bowl, but the clog is still blocking a free flow down the drain, leave the plunger in the bowl and fill the bowl with water again. Fill it to the point it is normally after a regular flush, then plunge again. Stubborn clogs might require you to do this a number of times.', '1. Purchase an enzyme waste removal product. Look for a product that contains a mixture of enzymes that liquify waste materials. These enzymes are used in septic systems to break down waste.\nProducts of this sort can be usually be purchased at home improvement stores in or near the plumbing aisle. Enzyme waste removal is preferable to using a drain-clearing chemical because it will not harm your pipes or the environment.\nThis method will only work on organic waste, not toys or other objects.', '2. Follow the instructions on the container. Pour the recommended amount of the enzyme product into the toilet bowl. You will typically be instructed to wait overnight for the enzymes to go to work on the clog. The toilet should drain once the clog has cleared.', ""1. Heat half a gallon of water. If the toilet tends to clog easily as the result of trying to flush too much waste, using a combination of hot water, baking soda and vinegar will often do the job as well as a commercial drain cleaner. Boil half a gallon of water, then let it cool for a moment while you add other ingredients to the toilet bowl.\nUse at least half a gallon. A small amount of water won't work, since it won't have enough force to push through the clog.\nThe water should be no hotter than a hot tea you can drink comfortably. It should not be boiling, since very hot water can crack porcelain. You want to raise the temperature of the water passing around or pressing on the clog."", ""2. Pour 1 cup baking soda and 2 cups vinegar into the toilet. The baking soda and vinegar create a chemical process that help to dissolve clogs. Distilled white vinegar is commonly used, but any type of vinegar will work. The mixture will fizz a great deal. \nIf you don't have baking soda and vinegar on hand, try adding a few squirts of dish soap to the toilet bowl. The soap may help to loosen the clog. \nThis method isn't likely to work for clogs caused by a hard obstruction, such as a toy."", '3. Pour the hot water into the bowl. Pour it from waist level, rather than right near the rim. The force of the water falling into the bowl can help to clear the clog.', ""4. Let the mixture stand overnight. In the morning, the water should have drained.  This homemade drain cleaner should successfully clear clogs caused by organic material. If the water won't flush on your second try, you may have hard obstruction causing the clog. Try using a wire coat hanger or a drain snake."", '1. Purchase or borrow a plumbing snake. A plumbing snake (also sometimes called a ""flexible cleaning tool"" or ""auger"") is a flexible coil of wire that can ""snake"" through the curves of a drain and get deeper than a wire can. The best snake is a ""closet auger"" which is designed specifically to clear toilet clogs without damaging or staining the bowl. A plumber would likely use a closet auger.', '2. Insert one end of the snake into the drain. Push down, feeding the snake further into the drain until you feel an obstruction.', '3. Twist and push the snake through the obstruction. The goal is to break up the obstruction into smaller pieces that can move through the pipes. It may take a few minutes of maneuvering to clear the obstruction. Once the water drains, flush the toilet to see whether it drains as quickly as normal.', '4. Snake in reverse. It may become necessary to remove the toilet and run the snake through in the opposite direction. This is especially true with hard obstructions that may have been flushed by a curious child. If the obstruction is known to be hard and you are not comfortable removing and replacing the toilet, contact a plumber.', '1. Unravel and straighten a wire coat hanger. Then wrap the end of the wire with a rag. Use duct tape to keep the rag in place. This will prevent the sharp end from damaging the porcelain in your toilet. The wire hanger method will generally work only if there is an obstruction in the first few inches of the drain.', ""2. Stick the wrapped end of the wire into the drain. Once the wire is in the drain, twist it, push it, and maneuver it in a circular motion to clear the drain. If you can feel the obstruction, push against it. Keep going until the water begins to drain.\nMake sure you're wearing rubber gloves as you do this. You may get splashed as you move the wire around.\nIf you can't feel an obstruction, and the toilet won't drain, the clog must be out of reach of the hanger. Try the plumbing snake method to clear it."", ""3. Flush the toilet once the water has drained. The obstruction and dirty water should now be able to flow through the drain like normal. If the toilet is still slow to drain, the obstruction may have gotten pushed further back, out of reach of the hanger. In this case you'll need to use a plumbing snake to clear it."", '1. Purchase a chemical drain cleaner. They\'re available at most grocery, hardware, and ""big box"" stores. Use this method only as a last resort. The chemicals used in drain cleaners are toxic to people and pets, corrosive to pipes. Also, chlorinated drain cleaner are very damaging to the environment.\nIf you suspect that there is a hard obstruction, do not use a chemical solution. Instead, use a snake or call a plumber.\nOnly use chemicals that are specifically made for toilets. Using other drain cleaners may damage your toilet.', ""2. Pour the specified amount into the toilet. Be sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions. Keep the lid down to prevent toxic fumes from filling your bathroom.\nNever use a plunger right after adding the drain-cleaning chemicals. The chemicals could possibly shoot back up onto your skin.\nMake sure the bathroom is well ventilated so you won't inhale the chemicals."", '1. Buy or borrow a wet/dry vacuum. If you have tried plunging and snaking to no avail, consider using a wet/dry vacuum. Do not use an ordinary vacuum cleaner––it must be the wet/dry variety that can cope with water.', '2. Empty the water out of the bowl using the vacuum. The bowl must be free of water and any other debris in order to vacuum out the obstruction.', '3. Place the end of the vacuum hose into the drain. Push it into the toilet bowl a few inches into the hole. Use just the flexible hose, rather than an attachment. Coil an old towel around the hole to create a seal around the drain.', ""4. Turn on the vacuum. Use one hand to put pressure on the towels to create a good seal. Wait a moment or two for the vacuum to work. There's a good chance the vacuum can suck out the clog.""]"
Personal Care and Style,"['1. Get the hair damp. Before you start cutting hair, spray it down so that you can easily mold and cut the hair. The hair should be lightly damp but not soaking wet. Take a towel and pat down the hair again to dry it slightly. Then grab a comb and part the hair. \n\nKnowing where the hair will be parted is important because you may have to blend the shorter side a little more than the longer side depending on the style.', '2. Choose the right guard size for the fade line. A lower guard size means a shorter cut. Pick a higher guard number to start with like a #3.\nYou can use a higher number to get an even shave around the sides and back of the head as a baseline.\nTo get the fade look you will switch to shorter guards as you move down. But by starting with the larger guard size you can easily get an even fade.\nYou will shave the entire sides and back of the hair with your first guard and then repeat with a lower guard, moving part way down the head, leaving the top the length you just cut.\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaura Martin\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLicensed Cosmetologist\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaura Martin is a Licensed Cosmetologist in Georgia.

The top can be short and blended or long and disconnected.""', ""3. Decide where you want the fade line(s). The fade line will determine where the hair transitions from one length to another. It will wrap all the way around the back of the head, essentially going from ear to ear.\nFade lines don't have to go straight across in the back. In fact, some fade lines dip slightly around the back of the head, then return to the original line before reaching the other ear.\nYou can have more than one fade line. Start with one on your first cut; as you get more confident, try doing two.\nWhere you position the fade line is a matter of personal taste. You can put it anywhere from slightly above the top of the ear to 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) above that."", '4. Section off the top portion of hair. Take a comb, and trace a rectangle above the round of the skull. This will separate the longer top hair from the shorter sides. Use a clip or an elastic band to keep this hair out of the way. \nIf you are uncertain how big the rectangle should be, use the eyebrows as a guide. The lines of the rectangle should line up with the outer tips of the eyebrows. Include the entire crown at the back of the head.', '5. Move the clippers vertically as you begin to shave the hair. Just like shaving your face, the general rule of thumb is to shave in the opposite direction that the hair grows. Start at the sideburns and move the clippers in an upward motion as you back towards the head.\nDo not cut the sectioned-off hair on top of the head.\nMove your clippers in an upward motion, moving out with an arc with each movement.\nWith your free hand, lightly press down on the scalp just below where you are currently cutting. This will ensure a smooth, even cut.', '6. Move the clippers sideways across the fade line. This doesn’t mean turning the clippers horizontally though, keep them vertical. Remember that the fade line is where the hair transitions from one length to the next.\nHold the clippers in your hand so that your thumb is over the top, with your other fingers beneath. Move your wrist in a ""flicking"" motion upward.\nTo make the fade lines disappear and give the hair a consistent transition, you want to angle the clippers so that only the bottom third or quarter of the blade is actually touching the head at the fade line.\nThe portion of the blade, the teeth, that isn\'t touching the head will still cut the hair, but at a ""natural"" fade angle.', '7. Keep a steady hand and move in small sections. The slower you go and the more precise you are, the better the cut will look, and you won’t spend a lot of time in the end cleaning up uneven spots.\nPush the clippers forward a bit on uneven spots to make sure the blades are catching the hair.\nTo cut behind the ears, pull the top of the ear down and cut straight up starting at the spot where the ear connects to the head. You may have to cut at an angle to get the hair behind the ear.', '8. Switch guards to continue fading the hair. Once you’ve got the base cut around the sides and back of the head, it’s time to switch to your next guard. If you Started with a #3, switch to a #2.\nRepeat the same shaving technique as before, starting at the bottom and moving up.\nDon’t go all the way to the top. To get an even fade you’ll want to pick a spot where your next fade line will be. This will vary from person to person, but your second fade line should be above the ear.\nDepending on how much of a fade you want, you may have to switch guards again and repeat the process, shaving the lower portion of the head with a #1.', ""9. Clean up the fade line with the clippers-over-comb method. Start to clean up the fade by grabbing a regular comb. (Use a white comb for dark hair, and a dark comb for light hair.)  Angle the comb so that it's at a 45-degree angle to the fade line and comb upward toward the top of the head, only moving the comb an inch or two into the hair. Run the clippers upward over the comb, from the fade line, so that they cut the hair that's above the teeth.\nRepeat this process around the fade line(s), taking care to keep your combing distance the same all the way around.\nIf done correctly, you should have a nice even fade with no visible fade lines. The hair should gradually get shorter as it gets closer to the base of the skull."", '10. Cut the top of the hair. Either use scissors if you want to keep the hair long, or a higher guard if you want a buzzed look. For something like a quiff, pompadour, or messy top, you’ll use scissors; while a caesar, or crew might need clippers.\n\nTo cut with scissors, use a comb or your fingers and pull the hair up, cutting above the fingers or comb a little at a time.The fingers or comb should be kept straight and parallel to the floor as you cut.\nTake into account the angle at which you are cutting. For a fade look with longer hair on top, you will want to cut the hair at an angle as you move towards the back of the head to blend it.\nCheck the corners as you cut. To do this, pull out a lock from the top of the hair and check the edges. The corners of this cut should be soft.\nIf too much hair is falling back from the top, you can use a thinning shear or clippers to trim it back.', '1. Shave the bottom of the hair with a beard trimmer or unguarded clippers. Now you want to make sure that fade has a distinct ending point at the base of the head and bottoms of the sideburns. Take your trimmer or clippers and shave any remaining hair away.\nYou may not need to do this to the sideburns if the person whose hair you are cutting has facial hair connecting to the sideburns.\nShave down the base of the neck and up a little way on the lowest fade to make sure that the hair is evened out.', '2. Blur out any remnants of the visible line using your clippers. Look for any patches where the hair is uneven now and make sure to go over them again to clean them up.\nYou may have to position your clippers at a bit of an angle to get any stragglers and even out the fade.', '3. Clean up the base of the neck. Now that your bottom fade line is established, cut the hair beneath it. Make sure you get the sections at the bottom of the neck that have thinner longer hairs.\nClean up the edges using a straight razor or the trimmer to make sure the edges of the cut are clean, as well as removing any neck hair.\nIf you are using a straight razor, apply shaving cream to the area you are about to cut, then pad with a warm damp towel.\nBrush off any loose hairs and style the top with a pomade or gel for a finished look.', ""1. Get a set of professional-grade clippers. Clippers can get expensive, but in order to ensure that you get a consistent fade, you’ll need clippers that are powerful and reliable. A great pair of clippers will make all the difference.\nSome popular and highly rated clippers are:\nOster Classic 76 Clipper w/ 2 Blades.\nWahl Senior clippers.\nAndis Master clippers.\n\nMake sure the clippers come with at least 5 different guard sizes.\nIt's also a good idea to purchase a professional trimmer, which is used to line sideburns and clean up the areas around the ears, neck and forehead.  Ask your barber where he purchases his, or look around online."", '2. Clean your clipper blades. Even if you have new clippers, you should make sure that they are clean before oiling them. Your clipper set should come with a cleaning solution, but if you don’t have a cleaning solution you can use distilled white vinegar.\nMake sure your clippers are unplugged and remove the blades.\nIf you have a solution, spray the solution over your blades and let it sit before wiping off.\nIf you are using distilled white vinegar put the blades to soak for a few minutes in a solution of vinegar.\nAvoid washing your clippers with soap and water as this can cause your blades to rust.', ""3. Oil the blades before use. Read the instructions that come with your clippers to see if you need to remove the blades for oiling, or if you can simply point them toward the bottom of a sink and drop oil onto them. After you've applied oil to the blades, wipe off any excess with a soft, dry cloth.\nWhen oiling your clippers, you should make sure that you’ve brushed off any excess hair that might be in the blades.\nTurn your clippers on and drip the oil onto the blades, allowing the moving blades to become saturated.\nRun the blades for about 20 seconds.\nThoroughly wipe the blades down, making sure that the tops of your blades are dry so hair doesn’t stick.""]"
Personal Care and Style,"['1. Place a medium-sized pot on the stove. Even though this recipe makes a fairly small batch of sugar wax (approximately enough for 2 legs), use a medium or large pot to make it.

Measure out the granulated white sugar and dump it into the pot. Then add the lemon juice and warm water. Stir to combine them.\nUse white or brown granulated sugar. Powdered sugar won't work at all."", '3. Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Turn your burner on high and let the mixture heat up until it starts to boil. Stir frequently. Keep an eye on the mixture, since it will start to bubble as it heats up.\nTake care not to burn the mixture. If you do, it will completely solidify once it cools down, making it unusable.', '4. Reduce the heat to medium. Once the mixture starts bubbling and boiling, turn the heat down to medium. Continue to stir frequently. The sugar should be completely dissolved in the liquid at this point.\nIf the mixture continues to bubble rapidly at medium heat, turn it down to low.', ""5. Remove the pot from heat when the mixture turns golden brown. Keep stirring the mixture as it simmers. Once it reaches a smooth consistency and becomes a deep golden color, turn off the heat and move the pot to another burner.\nThe consistency should be similar to hot syrup.

Pour it in a bowl or jar and give it about 30 minutes to cool down. If it still feels hot or warm enough to be uncomfortable, let it cool for several more minutes before proceeding.', '1. Scoop up a small amount of wax with your fingers. The wax should still be warm but cool enough to touch, so you can use your fingers for the entire process. Scoop up a small amount and roll the wax into a ball with your hands.\nYou can use a butter knife or a wooden popsicle stick instead of your hands, if you prefer.', ""2. Apply the wax to a small strip of skin. You can apply it with your fingers or a popsicle stick. Be sure to apply the wax in the opposite direction of hair growth.

Home and Garden,"[""1. Chop the onion about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the bottom. Place your onion on a cutting board and, using a sharp knife, cut off the bottom and remove the outer peel. Your onion piece should be about 1 in (2.5 cm) long to grow a healthy onion.\nIf you're growing the onions outside, start your cuttings in early spring. For onions grown indoors, any time of the year is fine.\nYou can use most onion varieties, including grocery store-bought onions, for growing more onions. This technique works best if you work with a fresh onion that has not yet gone bad."", '2. Leave the onion bottom out to dry for 12-24 hours. After chopping the onion, discard the rest of the onion and place the bottom on a flat, dry surface with the cut side up. Let the onion bottom dry out for up to a day until it is calloused and dry to the touch.\nIf not discarding, you can use the rest of the onion for cooking or for compost if you prefer.', '3. Poke toothpicks into each side of the onion. Divide your onion bottom into 4 sides, and poke a toothpick halfway into each side. The toothpicks should be equally spaced apart so they resemble an ""X"" in spacing.\nThis will allow you to suspend your onion over water while it roots.', ""4. Hang the onion over a small bowl of water. Fill a bowl with water to the brim and place it on a flat surface. Position the onion so the bottom just touches the top of the water, and leave it to grow for 3-4 days. Plant the cutting when it begins growing small, white roots from the bottom.\nThe bowl's diameter should be less wide than the length of the toothpicks.\nTo help the cutting grow faster, suspend the onion near a sunny window or place it outdoors."", '1. Fill a pot with well-draining soil. Purchase a well-draining soil mix and a large pot with holes in the bottom from a plant nursery. Fill the pot with the soil to about halfway full—you will fill it the rest of the way when you plant the onion cutting.\nYou can also plant your onion bottom outside if your garden has well-draining soil.\nYou can test to see if soil is well-draining by digging a 12 in (30 cm) hole in the soil and filling it with water. If the water drains in 5-15 minutes, the soil is well-draining.', '2. Place the onion cutting in the soil and fill the pot with soil. When the onion cutting grows white roots from the bottom, position it in the center of the soil. Fill the rest of the pot with soil over the onion until 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) from the top of the pot.\nDepending on your preference, you can keep the onion cutting indoors or outdoors in sunny weather.\nIf you plant the whole cut bottom as one piece, you may get more than one new onion but they will likely be crowded together and small.  The number of plants a single onion can grow will vary from 1-6, the onion pictured above can be divided into two.  To get multiple full size new onions from a single onion bottom, use a sharp knife to divide the onion bottom, leaving a portion of the roots on each section, as well as the leaves if it has started sprouting.', '3. Water the onion cutting immediately after planting it. Watering the onion cutting helps it adapt to its new environment and grow roots faster. Give your onion enough water that the soil is damp to the touch, but not soaking wet.', '4. Spray nitrogen fertilizer into the soil after watering it. Onions thrive in soil with a high nitrogen content. Spray nitrogen fertilizer directly into the soil and mix it with your hands to give your onion the nutrients it needs to grow.\nYou can buy nitrogen fertilizer from most garden stores or nurseries.\nCheck the label to determine how much fertilizer to spray into the soil.', '1. Give your onion about 1 in (2.5 cm) of water per week. Onions need plenty of water to stay healthy and grow more onions. Check the soil every day—if it feels dry to the touch, water your onion until it feels moist.', '2. Weed your garden regularly, if outside. Onions have a hard time competing with invasive plants, and weeds can steal their water and nutrients. Check your garden often for weeds and, if you notice any, pull them right away.\nAvoid spraying weed killers around the onion, as most herbicides can kill both weeds and garden plants.\nCheck for small insects or other pests on your onion as well and, if you see any, spray the onion with a non-toxic, plant-friendly insect repellent.', ""3. Fertilize your onion every 2 weeks. Fertilizing your onion plant regularly helps it grow large, healthy bulbs. Spray the onion plant at least twice a month with a nitrogen-rich fertilizer until the onion plant's bulb starts to poke from the soil.\nWhen the bulb starts poking out of the soil, stop fertilizing the onion until you harvest it."", '4. Harvest your onion when it forms flowers. When your onion starts to grow flowers, it\'s ready to harvest. Loosen the soil around the onion with your shovel and pull the onion by the base of its green foliage to pull it out of the ground.\nOn average, it takes onions grown from cuttings about 90-120 days to grow a new bulb.\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSteve Masley\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tOrganic Vegetable Gardener\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSteve Masley has been designing and maintaining organic vegetable gardens in the San Francisco Bay Area for over 30 years.

Relationships,"[""1. Keep your lips soft. A soft, smooth, and slightly moist mouth is ideal for kissing. Before you move in, you should make sure your lips aren't chapped or dry so your partner isn't distracted or put off by the state of your lips. If you want to soften your lips before you go in for the kiss, you should try these quick fixes:\nUse chapstick. Swipe some over your lips and press them together. (If you're a girl and you have flavored chapstick, all the better!) The only caveat is that you should apply lip balm or gloss an hour or more before you kiss, so your kissing partner feels your soft lips, not the thick layer of gloss over them.\nDrink water. Dry lips are a sign of dehydration, so throw back a tall glass of water (or two). You should notice your lips starting to smooth out within 20 to 30 minutes.\nLick your lips. If you're really in a pinch and have no time to spare, quickly run your tongue over your lips and press them together. This should moisten them slightly without making them slobbery or slick. You can even lick your lips a bit subtly while making eye contact with your kissing partner."", ""2. Freshen your breath. You never want to have bad breath when you are about to kiss someone, whether the kiss is a French kiss or not. Because your mouth will be open in a French kiss, fresh breath is especially important. Practice good dental hygiene. If you know you are about to kiss someone, take a second to brush your teeth or at least rinse out your mouth with water.\nAlways have breath mints or mint-flavored gum with you if you think there is a chance you might kiss someone while you are out. If you want to be subtle, you can quickly suck on a breath mint or chew gum for a minute in the bathroom, so you don't make it too obvious that you're ready to kiss.\nAvoid foods that leave an unpleasant aftertaste or residue, particularly garlic, coffee, onions, milk, and corn. If you're on a dinner date before the big kiss, try to eat strategically."", ""3. Find the right moment. A good kiss—especially a first kiss or first French kiss—is the culmination of building tension and growing intimacy. Choose your moment right to make sure you and your partner are both in a mindset to really lose yourselves in the kiss. You should have privacy and should both be feeling romantic instead of stressed or distracted, for one thing. When is the moment right? It depends on your individual situation, but here are a few signs to keep in mind:\nYou have complete privacy. Whether you're alone on your balcony or sitting on a secluded bench in a park, you're not worried that someone will interrupt you.\nThe other person keeps dropping hints, like locking eyes and looking at your lips, or standing or sitting progressively closer to you. Regardless of your partner's gender, their body language should give you a clue about whether now is the right time to make your move.\nYou're ending a date that went really well. In the car or on the porch are both good semi-private locations for a goodnight kiss.\nIt just seems right. If you feel overwhelmingly compelled to kiss someone, don't be too afraid to just go for it. (Just be prepared for an awkward or even troubling situation if you discover your intended didn't feel the same way.)\nAsk. If you aren't sure whether the other person is feeling it, bring up the topic. Better to get permission semi-awkwardly and go ahead with confidence than risk missing out on your chance to kiss that special someone (accidentally kiss someone who isn't interested)."", ""4. Make eye contact. Gaze deeply into the other person's eyes. If you want to make your intentions extra clear, slowly move your gaze to their lips, then back up to the eyes. You can even make intense eye contact, break it for a few seconds, and then look back at the person. This is a way of showing the person you want to kiss that you're pleasantly overwhelmed at the sight of them.\nGirls can even look at a guy, look down, and then look up through their lashes to be extra flirtatious."", ""5. Smile. If you're really excited about the prospect of kissing the other person, show it! A smile keeps the situation light and fun, while helping them feel safe and relaxed. Make sure your smile is soft and genuine, however, and not a forced, too-wide, or overly intense smile. Just slowly and languidly ease your lips into a smile. Show your future kissing partner how happy you are to be in their company. Continue to make eye contact as you do this, or break it for a few seconds before you return it.\nYou can opt for a close-lipped smile instead of smiling while showing your teeth, which might come off more as friendly than alluring or romantic."", ""6. Break the touch barrier. Once you're alone with the person you like and you're smiling and making eye contact, you can decide if you want to go in for the kiss without touching, or if you want to break the touch barrier first. This can mean sitting with your legs touching, holding hands, putting your hand on the person's knee, stroking the person's arm, or just giving a sign of affection. If you've kissed the person on the lips before, then breaking the touch barrier may feel more natural for you, and you should make an effort to touch the person before you touch lips so both of you feel more at ease.\nYou can also break the touch barrier as you're moving in to kiss the person. If you're standing, you can touch the person's arms, neck, or shoulders as you move in for the kiss. If you're sitting, you can put a hand on the person's back."", ""7. Move in. When the moment seems right, go in for the approach. In general, you should be moving slowly enough that the other person has time to say no, but not so slow that the moment loses its spark. When you start to get the feeling that your kissing partner is ready for the next step, you shouldn't dilly-dally. Move your body toward their body until your heads are just a few inches apart. That's when you'll have to start angling your head for the best kissing position.\nTake it slow. The slow approach builds tension and anticipation. Move in at a pace that gives the other person a chance to consent (or not). When they see you coming in, they may move to meet you, so going slow will prevent you from accidentally bumping heads."", ""8. Tilt your head slightly to one side. Meeting head-on will result in bumping noses. Instead, just tilt your head slightly to the left or right. If you notice the other person going in one direction, pick the opposite. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to do this perfectly. If you and your partner end up kissing each other head-on and bumping noses a bit, then you'll naturally adjust your heads into a more comfortable position, where your noses aren't in the way.\nUnlike what you may think from the movies, this doesn't have to happen in slow motion. You'll tilt your head as you move closer to the person, not at a snail's pace, so you don't have to worry about having the time to get it perfect."", ""9. Close your eyes. Just before you make contact, close your eyes. Kissing with your eyes open is generally associated with dishonesty and insincerity, and keeping your eyes closed will help you focus on and enjoy what's happening on your lips. Also, while you may be tempted to open your eyes to see what your kissing partner looks like in the throes of passion, this could actually unexpectedly make you crack up or not feel in the mood to kiss anymore. Closing your eyes can also help you focus on your mouth and to live in the moment, instead of trying to observe everything that's happening at close range.\nYou can slowly open your eyes later, when you pull apart after the kiss."", ""10. Keep your mouth in a kissable position. Don't present a stiff pucker, like you would if you went in to kiss your grandma — not only does it communicate non-romantic feelings, but it makes it physically difficult for your partner to initiate a French kiss. On the other hand, keeping your mouth completely loose and still also says that you're not interested. Here's how to hit a happy medium:\nPucker just a little. Push your lips forward slightly, so that you feel the slightest hint of muscle tension around them.\nOpen your mouth slightly. Instead of aggressively going in for a fully open-mouthed kiss at first, keep your lips just barely parted enough that a tongue could slip between them."", ""1. Lightly brush your lips over the other person's. Use feather-light pressure at first, so that your lips are just barely grazing over your partner's. This builds more anticipation and excitement than diving straight into a full-on French kiss. This also signals to your partner that you may be wanting more without being too forward about it.\nKeep your movements slow. A lot of quick, light kisses don't have the same level of sexiness as a barely-restrained build in tension. Act like you have all the time in the world—the kiss will speed up soon enough."", ""2. Test the waters. Once you've built a solid foundation for a French kiss with some tongueless kissing, you can give the other person some subtle hints that you're ready to kick it up a notch. In general, if it's your first time kissing the person, you should be a bit cautious before initiating a French kiss, because this may come off as too much too soon. But beyond that, here are some things to keep in mind as you test the waters to signal that you're ready to kiss with your tongue:\nOpen your mouth more widely. Offering unrestricted access invites the other person to make the first tentative tongue contact.\nLock lips, so that the other person's lower lip is between your two lips. Then, lightly sweep the tip of your tongue over the lower lip. Do one smooth, swift motion so that the contact lasts for less than a second. If they are interested, they'll reciprocate.\nKnow when to pull back. If you've tried both of the above techniques and your partner hasn't responded, simply leave it alone until next time and focus on regular kissing. Avoid making a big deal of it, or guilting them."", '3. Explore with your tongue. If the other person seems interested, go ahead and start French kissing for real. Remember to keep your tongue in motion and your touches light. First, just slowly slide your tongue into your partner\'s mouth. You can either begin by placing it above or below your partner\'s tongue, or even move it around the tongue a bit if you\'re feeling bold. Just make sure your partner\'s tongue is reciprocating your actions so you\'re not just kissing a limp tongue, or the romance will dissipate pretty quick. Here are some things to keep in mind as you explore the French kiss:\nStay playful. ""Tag"" the other person\'s tongue lightly and retreat back, inviting them to make the next move.\nTongues are loaded with nerve endings, and the mere act of touching your partner\'s tongue with your own will be very pleasant.\nDon\'t go too deep — jamming your tongue down the other person\'s throat is a big turn-off. Stay shallow and light at first. See how far your partner wants to go, and follow suit.', ""4. Breathe. If you’re kissing for an extended period, it’s easy to forget to breathe. Believe it or not, gasping and turning blue isn't very romantic. You may think that a truly passionate kiss involves many minutes of non-stop kisses, but if you really want to up the romance factor, then you have to stay alert and conscious. Once you fall into a rhythm, you should be able to find a suitable pattern for breathing without interrupting the flow of your kisses. Here's what you need to know:\nTake small breaths through your nose as you kiss.\nDon't be afraid to take a break. If you do it right, it can still be an intimate and sexy moment. Pull back slightly so that your foreheads are still touching, make eye contact, and smile.\nAs you and your partner grow comfortable with the kiss, you can try breathing through your mouth a little: sharing breaths as well can be romantic (but not everybody likes it)."", ""1. Mix it up. Kisses are like snowflakes: no two are exactly the same. Once you feel comfortable French kissing someone, it is tempting to try to do the same thing every time, but you should resist if you want to keep things interesting. You should be able to fall into a nice, comfortable rhythm while adding enough variety from time to time to keep things interesting. Here's what you can vary:\nSpeed: Varying the speed of your kisses is a good way to try something different without potentially intimidating your partner. Once you've got the slow kiss mastered, try going a little faster for a few seconds — it should leave you both a little breathless!\nDepth: Once you're comfortable with someone, try kissing a little more deeply.  The key to pulling this off is keeping your speed under control. Or, if you want things to be a little more flirty and playful, return to shallow kisses.\nPressure: Like a deep kiss, a hard kiss should be reserved for a situation in which you already know both you and your partner are comfortable. Be a little bit more forceful with your tongue, but be sure to keep it in motion.\nTeeth: You may want to try rubbing the backs or front of the other person's teeth with your tongue. This can create a ticklish feeling that might enhance your kiss. You could also try lightly catching the other person's lower lip with your teeth. Be aware, though, that not everyone likes their kisses with a side of teeth — be prepared to put your chompers away."", ""2. Use your hands. While you should keep your hands polite, especially on a first kiss, you don’t necessarily want them just dangling at your sides. Using your hands and touching your partner's body (while keeping it respectful) can enhance the romantic feeling of the kiss and can make you and your kissing partner feel more connected. Once you make contact with your partner's body, you can move your hands around gently from time to time without being frantic about it. Here's what you need to know about using your hands while you French kiss:\nAs a general rule, start with your hands on your partner's hips and then slowly move them around their back or up to the face and hair.\nAnother turn-on for the first kiss is to gently caress the other person's shoulder. It shows you are comfortable with them.\nCradle your partner's face with your hands on their cheeks and their neck.\nOr, go for an old standby: simply wrap your arms around your partner in an embrace."", '3. Read your partner\'s body language. Everybody kisses a little differently, and each person enjoys different things in a kiss — there is no ""right"" way to kiss. Good kissing requires give-and-take, so read your partner’s body language and pay attention to clues that tell you you’re doing something they like. The most important thing is to make sure that your kissing partner is comfortable with the pace of your kissing and affectionate gestures.\nNot everybody likes to be kissed the same way, so while your former partner might have enjoyed one method of kissing, your new love might not. You need to learn to read signals and adapt to a style that\'s comfortable for each of you.\nIf your partner pulls away or seems uncomfortable at any time, understand that you have to slow it down.\nLet your partner kiss you back and move with them as long as you’re comfortable with what they are doing.\n\nListen for clues that tell how much your partner is enjoying a particular maneuver. If you hear a sigh or moan, or they begin kissing you back with increased intensity, you\'re on the right track.', ""4. Practice. Good French kissing, like good kissing of any kind, requires practice. You will get better as you do it more. In addition, the more practice you have with one person, the more comfortable you will feel kissing them and developing a style that suits both of you. Just because you may not have had a stellar first kiss doesn't mean that you and your kissing partner are romantically doomed; have patience and keep kissing slowly and gently until you fall into a rhythm that works for you.\nDon't take yourselves too seriously, either. If you tried something that just plain failed, it's okay to laugh, to lightly apologize, and to try again. If you act devastated after a disappointing kiss, you'll only be making things weird for your partner, and there's no need for that.\nMost first kisses, like most first attempts at love-making, aren't anything to write home about. Part of the fun is getting better at it — together."", ""5. Communicate. If you really like the way your partner kisses you, let them know. If you don't like something, also let your partner know that, but approach it delicately and compliment them at the same time on something they did that you liked. If your partner is being honest and open with you, try not to overreact or get hurt, or this may make your partner feel hesitant to communicate with you in the future.\nEven if the kiss goes all wrong, it can still be an intimate affair if you can both laugh about it together! The important thing is that you're both honest about how you're feeling and what you want to do to improve.\nYou should also communicate by telling your partner how attractive they look, and how much you like them. Make it clear how happy you are to be with the person you're with, and the French kissing will come all the more naturally.""]"
Health,"['1. Choose an N95 face mask to filter out particles in the air. N95 face masks are a great choice for protecting your lungs from particles in the air, which could be metal fumes (such as those caused by welding), minerals, dust, or biological particles, such as viruses. You can wear one when there’s been a flu outbreak in your area, or if pollutants or a fire has made air quality poor. These masks are made of structured, lightweight foam and fit over your nose and mouth.\nSpecially-made versions are also available for people in industrial jobs, and surgical N95 face masks are available for those in health care professions.\nThe number refers to the percentage of particles that the mask can filter out. The N95 mask filters out 95% of dust and particulates.\nN95 masks shouldn’t be used if oil aerosols are present, as oil damages the filter. The “N” actually stands for “Not resistant to oil.”', '2. Go with an R or P mask if you’ll be exposed to an oily atmosphere. In cases where you face exposure to mineral, animal, vegetable, or synthetic oils, look for an R or P designated mask. The “R” stands for “somewhat oil-resistant,” which means it will protect you from oil vapors for a time limit specified on the packaging. The “P” stands for “oil-proof or strongly resistant.”\nThese masks also come with number classifications, such as P100 and R 95. The numbers stand for the percentage of particles they filter out.\nIf you’re exposed to gases or vapors which are more concentrated than the exposure limits of these masks, look for a respirator that uses special canisters or cartridges to filter the air even more effectively.', '3. Try on different sizes to get the best fit. Depending on the particular N95 mask you choose, available sizes range from extra small and small to medium and large. If possible, try on a couple of sizes before you purchase one. Make sure the mask feels snug and doesn’t slip on your face, remembering that you’ll also mold it to your face for an even tighter fit. If you’re not sure, go for a smaller size to make sure the mask won’t fall off.', '4. Check with your doctor if you have a respiratory or cardiac condition. N95 face masks can make it more difficult to breathe, especially if you have a chronic cardiac or respiratory condition. Talk with your doctor to see what extra precautions you can take. You may be able to use a model with exhalation valves, which can ease breathing and lessen heat build-up in the mask, although these versions shouldn’t be used if you need to maintain a sterile environment, like an operating room. Talk to your doctor before using if you have any of the following conditions:\nBreathing problems\nEmphysema\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\nAsthma\nCardio-pulmonary\nImmune compromised medical condition problems', '5. Buy a NIOSH-certified N95 face mask from hardware stores or online. You can get an N95 mask at hardware or home improvement stores and pharmacies. You can also purchase directly from online retailers, like 3M. It’s important to only choose masks that are certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). These masks will have the NIOSH logo and a certification approval number on the packaging or the mask.\nIf you need an N95 mask for your job, your employer will likely be required to provide it.\nMasks that aren’t NIOSH-certified may not provide good protection.', '6. Stock up on face masks so you’ll be ready when you need them. Face masks tend to have large spikes in demand and sell out fast during certain times, such as during an outbreak of an infectious illness or when a region experiences intense pollution. Be prepared by having some on hand for you and each of your family members at all times. Aim to have 2-3 masks per family member to be on the safe side.\nTake your local environment into account when stocking up on masks. You’ll need more if you live in a big city with notable pollution problems, for example, than if you live in a more rural environment with cleaner air.', '1. Trim your facial hair before wearing your mask, when possible. If you know you need to wear an N95 mask, shave off all facial hair. It can get in the way of the mask and prevent a tight, sealed fit, which will compromise the effectiveness of the mask.\nIf it’s an emergency situation and you don’t have time to shave, fit the mask on as best you can.', '2. Wash your hands well before putting on your mask. Use soap and water and dry your hands well so you don’t get the mask wet. This will prevent you from accidentally contaminating your mask before you put it on.', '3. Cup the mask in one hand and place it over your mouth and nose. Place the mask in the palm of your hand so that the straps face the floor. Set it over your nose and mouth with the nosepiece fitting over the bridge of your nose. The bottom should go just under your chin.\nTry to touch only the outside and edges of the mask to keep it clean.', '4. Pull the bottom and top straps over your head. If your mask has two straps, pull the bottom one over your head and secure it around your neck, just under your ears. Continue to hold the mask tightly against your face with the other hand. Then, pull the top strap over and set it above your ears.', '5. Mold the nose piece around the bridge of your nose. Set your first 2 fingertips on either side of the metal nose clip at the top of your mask. Run your fingers down both sides of the strip, molding it along the bridge of your nose.\nIf your mask doesn’t have a nosepiece, simply make sure the fit is tight and snug around your nose.', '6. Look for alternate solutions for children. N95 masks are not designed for children and won’t fit correctly on them. Instead, keep children inside as much as possible if air quality is poor. Take extra precautions in case of flu outbreaks, such as having kids wash their hands before meals and after sneezing or coughing. You can also try using masks made specifically for children, although they won’t be N95-designated.\nDon’t use an N95 mask on children younger than age 17-18.\nOlder teenagers can try on an N95 mask to test the fit and comfort. If it fits well and forms a tight seal, have them try walking around with it, paying close attention to any feelings of dizziness or difficulty breathing. If these symptoms occur, have them remove the mask and go inside.', '1. Breathe through the mask and test for leaks. Set both hands against the mask and take a breath to make sure that it seals against your face. Then exhale, feeling for any leakage from the nosepiece or around the edges. If you feel air leaking from the nose area, re-mold the nosepiece. If it’s coming from the edges of the mask, adjust the placement of the straps on the sides of your head.\nIf your mask still isn’t completely sealed, ask a friend or family member for help, or try a different size or model.', '2. Remove your mask by pulling the straps over the top of your head. Without touching the front of the mask, pull the bottom strap over your head. Let it hang down over your chest. Then, pull the top strap over.\nYou can either throw the mask away or store it in a clean, sealed container or bag.\nAvoid touching the mask itself, as it might be contaminated.', '3. Throw away your mask if you used it in a medical setting. If you used your mask with an ill patient, or as a way to prevent getting sick in an outbreak, the outside of your mask is likely contaminated. Disposing of it properly will ensure that you won’t come into contact with contaminated particles. Carefully hold the mask by the straps and throw it away in a trash can.', '4. Re-wear your mask as long as it stays dry and fits tightly. If you’re using the mask to protect from environmental hazards and it hasn’t come into contact with harmful germs, it should be fine to wear again. Test the seal of your mask each time you put it on to make sure it still fits snugly. Store your mask in a clean, sealed container or bag and make sure it doesn’t get bent out of shape by surrounding objects.']"
Hobbies and Crafts,"['1. Learn the 10 basic 5-card hands and their ranking. No matter what type of poker you play, the hands will always be the same. To start familiarizing yourself with the different hands, print out a ""cheat sheet"" and study it. Then, memorize the different hands so you can easily recognize them. Here are the winning poker hands, from highest to lowest:\nThe highest-ranking hand is a royal flush (the royal straight flush). This hand includes a 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace of the same suit, one kind (all clubs, diamonds, hearts or spades). It can only be tied but not beaten by the royal flush of another suit.\nA straight flush is made up of 5 consecutive cards of the same suit.\n\n4 of a kind means you have 4 cards of the same rank (but different suits, of course) and a fifth card of any rank (such as 4 aces and a 9). If you have 4 aces, then no one can have any hand with an ace, so that no royal flush is available.\nA full house contains 3 matching cards of 1 rank and 2 matching cards of another rank.\nA flush contains any 5 cards of the same suit. These skip around in rank or sequence, but are from the same suit.\nA straight contains 5 cards of consecutive rank but from more than one suit.\n\n3 of a kind means you have 3 cards of the same rank, plus two unmatched cards.\n\n2 pair is made up of two cards of one rank, plus two cards of another rank (different from the first pair), plus one unmatched card.\n\nPair means you have 2 cards of the same rank, plus 3 other unmatched cards.\n\nHigh card is the lowest-ranking (called a ""nothing"") hand, when no two cards have the same rank, the five cards are not consecutive, and they are not all from the same suit.Tip: Keep in mind that if two people face off with the same type of hand, the hand with the higher-ranking cards wins. If the hands have the exact same ranks of cards (suit does not matter), it is a tie and the prize, if any, is split evenly.', '2. Place the blinds (starting bets) or ""ante up."" In poker, bets are placed at the beginning of the game in one of 2 ways. In Texas Hold’em, the player next to the dealer typically places a small blind bet that’s half of the usual minimum bet, while the player to that person’s left places a big blind that’s at least the minimum bet. As another option, each player can “ante up” the minimum starting bet, which means placing a minimum starting bet into the pool.\nAside from Texas Hold’em, most poker variants use an “ante up” system.', '3. Look at the 2 cards the dealer gives you, which is your hand. The dealer will ""burn"" the first card on the deck, which means placing it out of play. Then, they\'ll pass out 2 cards to each player. Check your cards to see what you\'re holding.\nIn poker, the dealer will burn a card every round of dealing. That way, it’s harder for players to anticipate what card is coming up and the game becomes more of a gamble.\nThe dealer will always pass out the cards in a clockwise direction, starting on the left.Tip: Players don’t show their hands to anyone else until they reach the showdown. Even if another player is out, it’s best to keep your cards a secret. You don’t want them to accidentally (or purposely) reveal the value of your cards.', '4. Bet, call, or raise after each round is dealt if you want to. Every time the dealer puts out new cards, you\'ll make a bet, with the first bet being made solely based on the two cards the players have in their hands. Betting happens in a circle – when it\'s your turn to bet, you have a few options. At this point you can:\nPlace an initial bet if no one else has yet.\nSay ""check"" to avoid betting.\nSay ""call"" to match the bet someone else has made.\nSay ""raise"" to add more money to the betting pool. If you ""raise,"" the other players will go around in a circle and choose to either ""call"" your new bet or fold.\nSay ""fold"" if someone else has bet and you don\'t want to match their bet. If you fold, turn your cards into the dealer face-down to avoid giving the other players any advantages!', '5. Look at the “flop” to see if you have a good hand. After the first round of betting, the dealer will ""burn"" the top card on the deck. Then, they\'ll put 3 cards face up on the table, which is called the ""flop."" These are the community cards that every player can use to build their hand. Compare these cards and the cards in your hand, then place a bet, call a bet, or fold.\nIn total, the dealer will reveal 5 cards. You will have 7 cards total to use to create your best hand of 5: your two personal cards in your hands, and the five community cards on the table. While your luck can turn later on in a game, take some time to analyze the table after the ""flop"" – are you well-positioned to end the game with a good hand?\nDepending on the rules where you’re playing, you can also draw replacement cards for the cards in your hand. This is usually done during or just after the betting round.', '6. Check the “turn” card after the second round of betting. The dealer will ""burn"" the top card, then they\'ll place 1 card face up next to the flop. This is called the “turn” card or the “fourth street” card. Check all of the cards on the table and the cards in your hand to see if you want to bet, call, or raise.\nYour game may also allow a card exchange at this point, but this isn’t typical in professional games.\nAs you look at the cards, think about the possible hands other players might have. For instance, if all 4 cards on the table are spades, then any player who has a spade in their hand will have a flush, which means they have 5 cards from the same house.\nSimilarly, if the cards on the table are 5,6,7, and 8, then anyone with a 4 or 9 will have a straight.\nIf you have nothing good in your hand but the cards on the table make for an easy winning hand, then you may want to fold, as it’s likely another player has a winning card.', '7. Examine the ""river"" card and decide on the hand you\'ll play. After the dealer ""burns"" the top card on the deck, they\'ll put 1 last card face up next to the “turn” card. This final card is called the “river.” Check your hand and the community cards to decide on your best 5-card hand. Then, bet, call, or fold.\nIf the rules allow it, you may be able to exchange your hand 1 final time before or after betting. However, this isn’t common in professional games.', '8. Reveal each player’s hand clockwise in the final “showdown.” After each player calls, folds, or bets in the last round, each remaining player will participate in the “showdown.” Starting to the left of the dealer, all players involved will reveal their cards face up. Then, everyone looks at the turned over hands to see who has the highest value hand to win the entire pot.\nIf there is a tie, the tied players split the pot.\nIf you fold your hand, then you don’t have to show your cards.\nIn Texas Hold’em, there are 5 cards on the table and 2 cards in your hand. You can create any 5-card combination using these 7 cards. The remaining cards aren’t counted.\nIf you want to play the cards on the table only, this is called “playing the board.” However, it’s an option that everyone has, so it may not be the best strategy.', '1. Guesstimate the risks on your starting hand. Look at your cards to see what you’re holding. Check for a pair, 2 consecutive numbers, cards that are from the same house, or face cards, which may be good cards. Then, decide if it’s worth placing a bet to see what the community cards will be.\nYou should almost always raise when your hand is a pair, face cards, or aces. An ace and a king or an ace and a queen are strong hands as well. If you have these hands, bet before the flop to raise the value of the pot.\nIf the card you need doesn’t turn up, you can either bluff or fold. Sometimes, with good bluffing skills and some luck, a bad hand can win the whole game.', '2. Start the bidding with the player to the left of the big blind or dealer. On the first round, bidding starts to the left of the big blind. In later rounds, the bidding starts to the left of the dealer. From there, the bidding goes clockwise.\nIf you’re playing a game with an ante instead of a blind, always start betting with the player to the left of the dealer.', '3. Call the bet if you want to stay in but don’t have great cards. This means you want to stay in the game but don’t want to raise the bet. When you call, match the bet of the person before you by adding your chips or money to the pot. Your turn is now over.\nIf the flop comes and you’re holding a hand that doesn’t play, check and fold. You don’t want to keep betting money at a hand that won’t win.\nIf the flop comes and you have a strong hand, bet at it. This will force weaker hands out and raise the value of your pot.', '4. Raise the bet if you have a good hand. When the bet comes to you, tell the other players you want to raise. Then, say how much you are betting and place your money or chips into the pot. This ends your turn.\nSay, “I raise the bet to $30.”\nYou can’t raise the bet above the maximum for your game.Variation: You might decide to go ahead and raise the bet to trick everyone into thinking you have good cards. This is called “bluffing.” It’s a strategy used to win a hand even with bad cards. You can “bluff” at any point in the game, but it’s a risky strategy because your bluff might get called.', '5. Fold if the current bet is too high or you have a bad hand. This means quitting the round of poker. To fold, place your cards face down on the table and say, “I fold.” Then, add your cards to the discard pile.\nDon’t show your cards when you fold during a game, as this can spoil which cards are out of play. That may give certain players an upper hand.\nThe key to being successful at poker is knowing when to fold your hand and accept a smaller loss or when to hold onto it and risk a larger loss for a chance to win the pot.', '6. Decide if you want to draw any cards (if the game allows it). Look at your cards and decide if you want to play this hand. If you’d like to try for better cards, discard the cards you don’t want. Then, draw replacement cards from the draw pile at the center of the table. \nYou can discard as many cards as you’d like.\nYou may not be allowed to draw new cards when playing Texas Hold’em, so check the rules for your game before you start playing.', '7. Play only with money you’re willing to lose. When you are learning, you should never gamble more than you would consider acceptable to lose. During the game, don’t add to your bankroll or dive back in after losing everything you planned to gamble. Wait until you’re comfortable losing that amount again before you play another game.\nThe general rule of thumb is you should be able to easily afford to lose 200 bets at the highest limit. So if the limit is $5 bets, then your bankroll should be $1000, and stop there.\nTrack your wins and losses if you start getting more serious about poker. This will help you figure out whether you are winning or losing in the long run.\nRemember that you must keep records and pay taxes on your gambling income to avoid legal trouble.', '8. Learn to read basic tells. Playing your opponents is arguably even more important than playing your cards in poker. This is a more advanced aspect of the game, but it’s always good to be aware of players’ tells—especially your own. Watch for betting patterns such as betting early, very often (probably with weak hands), or late in a hand (as intimidation). Physical tells can also give you an estimation of your opponent’s strength of hand and help you keep your own strategy secret by avoiding such patterns.\nSome classic tells include shallow breathing, sighing, nostrils flaring, flushing red, eyes watering, blinking, swallowing excessively, or an increasing pulse seen in the neck or temple.\nA hand over the mouth is usually to conceal a smile, while shaking hands usually reveal nerves.\nIf a player glances at his or her chips when the flop comes, they probably have a strong hand.\nIf a mediocre player tries to impress you by staring you down, they are likely bluffing.', ""9. Identify conservative players from aggressive players. This will help you determine players' betting patterns and read them more easily. You can tell if players are more conservative by noticing those folding early—evidently only staying in a hand when their cards are good.\nVery conservative players won’t lose as much money, but they're easily spotted by more experienced players. Because they tend to avoid high betting, they can often be bluffed into folding.\nAggressive players are risk takers that often bet high early in a hand before seeing how the other players are acting on their cards."", '1. Practice and watch others play to develop quick instincts. The more you play and watch, the faster and better you’ll get. Since every poker game is different, it’s important to develop good instincts rather than try to memorize and apply tricky systems. Observe experienced players and imagine how you’d react in their position. Then, watch how the experienced players react to build your own instincts.\nWhile you do this, consider how successful you’d have been if you were playing and reacted as you did. Would you have won, or would you have lost? Then, decide how you can improve your strategy going forward.', '2. Shuffle the cards and cut the deck before they’re dealt. Shuffling the cards mixes them up to make the game more fair. To do a basic shuffle, split the deck into 2 stacks. Next, hold a stack in each hand close together and facing each other. Use your thumbs to flip through the cards, combining the deck into one. After the cards are shuffled, get someone who isn’t the dealer to cut the deck by separating it into 2 stacks and placing the bottom stack on top.\nDo several shuffles to make sure the cards are mixed up.\nYou can cut the deck more than once if you’d like.\nThe dealer typically does the shuffling and bets last, which is called the “button” position. After each hand, you’ll pass the dealer/button position to the next player on the left. If the dealer is always the same person, like in a casino, the button position will still pass clockwise around the table.', '3. Say “check"" to skip placing a bet or simply tap the table twice with two fingers. You can say this if you are the first better or if all those already betting have checked. If you say ""check"" when it\'s your turn at the beginning of a new hand, that means you are choosing not to place a bet at that point. Instead, you pass the chance to open to the next player.\nIn the following rounds, if you say “check,” that means you’re staying with the bets you already paid into the pot during this hand, and you won’t pay more until someone else raises during their turn.\nIf another player does raise on that hand, then you nor anyone else can say ""check"" or maintain your “check”—so when the play comes around to you again you have to either match or raise the latest bet or fold your hand.', '4. Say ""I open"" if a bet hasn’t been placed yet and you want to open betting. For example, you could raise the ante $1 or at least the agreed minimum raise. If you choose not to open, take turns in clockwise order, until someone else has opened or every player checked. If everyone checks, then it is time to choose to discard and draw 1 to 3 cards, or ""hold pat"" on the cards you have. When there are fewer than 3 cards available to draw, replacements will be drawn.\nThe dealer will have to shuffle the discards and add them to the bottom of the draw stack.', '5. Say “call” if you want to bet the same as the last person. Calling means making a bet equal to the last bet or raise. For example, if the person right of you just bet $10 and it\'s now your turn, you would say ""call"" or “I call” to match that bet. Then you would place $10 in chips or cash in the pot.', '6. “Raise” to increase the current betting amount. This is also known as “sweetening the pot.” Raise or re-raise requires finishing this round and making another round to now allow any others to ""call"" or ""raise"" the amount of that last bet to stay in the game, or else ""fold"". The ones who already called can check on this turn and the hand is finished unless someone re-raises.\nIf someone before you bets $20 and you think you have a winning hand or you want to bluff, you can raise when it\'s your turn by saying “raise to $30.”\nHowever, do not say “I see your 20, and I’ll raise you 10…” Despite being popular in movies, this is actually frowned upon as sloppy table talk.', ""7. Say “I fold” when you're ready to quit a hand. Folding means forfeiting your cards and giving up that pot with any bets you've made into it. Wait to be dealt into the next hand if you have chips or have not reached your limit of losses. To fold when it’s your turn, put your cards face down on the table and place them onto the discard pile.\nYou can fold at any point in a hand when it’s your turn."", '8. “Cash-in” when you’re ready to quit the game. This means exchanging your poker chips for money. If you still have chips but don’t want to play anymore, take your chips to the bank and tell them you’re ready to cash in. The bank will determine how much money your chips represent, then they’ll hand you cash.\nYou can usually return and watch the game after you cash in.', '1. Master the basics of five-card draw. This variation has optional rules that can be agreed on before the game begins, such as whether or not to use jokers and wildcards, or which cards are high and low. The object of the game is similar to Texas Hold ‘Em: to get the best 5-card hand, but within the bounds of the your own 5-card hand, without common cards.\nDetermine the betting structure by deciding if you’ll play fixed-limit, pot-limit, or no-limit.\nDecide on the dealer by asking ""Who deals first?"". Depending on the group you’re with and where you’re playing, a dealer may be elected or each player could draw for the position. The organizer or host may also choose to deal first.', '2. Learn 3-card draw. In this game, the players start by making an ante bet. The dealer and each of the players then get 3 cards, and the players must decide whether to make a play bet or fold. Finally, the dealer reveals their cards for a showdown and whoever has the best hand wins.\nLike with 5-card draw, you can choose to vary the rules if you’re playing at home. For instance, jokers can be wild, meaning they can be used in represent any card value.', '3. Study some of the more obscure variations. If you really get into the game or just want to impress others with your knowledge of poker, learn the rules of the other variations. These include Straight Poker, 5-Card Stud, 7-Card Stud, Lowball, Omaha, Pineapple, Crazy Pineapple, Cincinnati, and Dr. Pepper.\nYou can learn more about these games online.']"
Relationships,"[""1. Drop hints that you're interested.  You can put out some subtle signals that you're angling for a kiss without coming right out and saying it.  Here's how to communicate it romantically:\nGet caught looking (briefly) at the other person's lips.\nDon't purse your lips.  Keep them softly parted — not so much that you could breathe comfortably through the opening, but enough that you could bite your bottom lip easily.\n\nMake your mouth appealing.  Use chapstick or lipgloss to smooth over flaky lips, and keep your breath fresh with mints or spray. Avoid gum, which you might have to spit out awkwardly if the other person goes in for a kiss."", ""2. Break the kiss barrier (optional).  If you're feeling brave, test the waters with a small kiss on the hand or the cheek.  If the other person seems interested, it's probably safe to proceed with a kiss on the mouth.\n\nIf you're kissing a girl: Take her hand and slowly lift it to your mouth.  Gently press your lips into the back of your hand for 2 or 3 seconds before breaking away.\n\nIf you're kissing a guy: Lean in and plant a 2- or 3-second kiss on his cheek.  Keep your lips soft, and avoid puckering like you would if you were kissing a family member.  If you want your intentions to be extra clear, aim for the part of his cheek just to the side of his lips."", '3. Set the mood with a romantic compliment.  Go big and pay the other person the sincerest compliment you can think of.  If you get it right, the other person might take the lead and lean in to kiss you.\nSay it in an intimate way. Lower the volume and tone of your voice slightly, and lock eyes.  Not only does this communicate that you have deep feelings for this person, it entices him or her to come closer to hear you.\nFocus on an alluring quality.  Even if you truly think that your date is an amazing basketball player, now might not be the best time to bring it up.  Instead, base your compliment on how you see your date as a romantic partner.  Try these lines:\n""You are SO beautiful.""\n""Your eyes drive me crazy.""\n""I love to see you smile.""\n""I am so lucky to be with you right now.""', '4. Consider asking for a kiss directly. If all else fails, go for broke and state your intentions. If your date hasn\'t picked up on any of your hints and you\'re dying to lock lips, you might as well be straightforward and just ask if you can kiss him or her.  Don\'t worry, though — you can be direct while still being romantic and compelling.  Try these phrases if you\'re at a loss for words:\n""I\'d love nothing more than to kiss you right now.""\n""I\'m sorry if this is too forward, but I\'d really like to kiss you.""\n""I want to kiss you so much that it is just about killing me.""', ""5. Go in for the kiss.  Don't waste any time once you have the go-ahead — close your eyes, lean in and smooch!  The next sections will discuss some kissing techniques, as well as how to handle kissing in different dating situations such as a first kiss or kissing after a date."", ""1. Keep your lips soft.  Tense puckers are for family members or people you're obligated to kiss, but keeping your mouth slightly parted and soft communicates a sense of openness."", ""2. Do a few soft kisses.  Start slow with soft, gentle kisses and skip the tongue and the teeth — for now.  If your partner seems receptive, you can move forward to French kissing.\nTry to avoid letting your lips smack.  The noise can be distracting, and might break your immersion in the moment.  If you do find yourself smacking, slow down and part your lips a bit more.\nStay light at first.  Avoid smashing your lips against your date's mouth — for now.  Kissing softly and gently gives the other person the chance to stop if it's uncomfortable, as well as allowing you to gauge his or her interest."", '3. Stay at a manageable level of saliva.  Slobbery puppies are the last thing you want your date thinking of while you kiss him or her.  Avoid this fate by swallowing excess saliva occasionally.  If you notice that your lips are a bit too wet, pull away and discreetly purse them to bring the extra spit back into your mouth.', '4. ""Lock"" lips.  If your initial kisses have gone well, try a lip lock, which can lead to closer kisses (and is a nice gateway for French kissing). Basically, you\'ll ""stack"" your lips so that (for instance) it looks like this:\nYour lower lip\nYour partner\'s lower lip\nYour upper lip\nYour partner\'s upper lip\nAt first, putting your partner\'s lower lip between yours is the safest bet.  Most people have larger lower lips, making them easier to grab gently with your lips.', ""5. Make sure to breathe.  Ideally, you'll be able to breathe softly through your nose while you're kissing.  If that's not possible, though, break away for a second to take a breath.\nDon't feel self-conscious about being out of breath or needing to take a break for a second.  Breathing hard is an indication that you're nervous and excited, which your partner will probably find flattering."", ""6. Use your hands. Don't just let your hands hang at your sides like two limp fettuccini noodles — put them to good use!\nPlace your hands lightly on your partner's shoulders or around his or her waist. (In Western culture, girls generally put their hands on a boys shoulders while he puts his hands around her waist.)\nTake the intimacy up a notch by pulling your partner in closer.\nPut your hands on the sides of his or her face, using your thumb to sweep across the cheekbone, or put one hand under his or her chin and tilt it upward.\nAnother seriously sensual move is to put both hands around the back of your partner's head and tangle them in his or her hair, gently pulling."", ""7. Test using tongue.  Once you're in a lip lock with your partner's lower lip between both of yours, lightly run the tip of your tongue over it.  If you can move it slowly, even better.\nSee how your partner responds.  If he or she presses in closer or returns the gesture, you're probably clear to keep increasing the intensity of the kiss.  If your date pulls away, maybe it's best to pull back the tongue for now and stick to lips-only kisses."", ""8. Try French kissing (optional).  Using your tongue during a kiss is, in Western culture, referred to as a French kiss. Why do the French get the credit? Who knows! Here's how to get started:\nSweep your tongue along the inside of your partner's lower lip.  Try to move slowly and lightly at first, increasing speed and pressure only if your partner seems to respond well.\nSlide the tip of your tongue inside your partner's mouth and gently move it against the tip of his or her tongue. Use light, darting motions and keep your tongue moving — letting it sit limply in your partner's mouth isn't appealing and will bring a quick end to the kissing.\nTry deeper and harder strokes if your partner seems responsive."", ""9. Mix it up. Don't feel obligated to keep the intensive tongue activity going forever.  Alternate soft and hard, slow and fast, deep and shallow.  You can even go back to using only your lips for a few minutes.\nAlternating your technique will keep your partner from being able to predict what's coming next.  Maintaining this sense of surprise and spontaneity helps your kisses avoid becoming stale."", ""10. Gently nibble your partner's lips (optional).  Teeth aren't a necessary element of kissing, but a grazing them over your partner's lip can introduce another unexpected element.  Here are some quick pointers:\nKeep the pressure as light as possible.  Remember that you're aiming to nibble, not bite.\nMove slowly.  Again, keeping your pace gentle will help prevent accidentally chomping on your partner's lip.\nWhen your lips are locked, place your teeth over your partner's lower lip and slowly pull back until your teeth are almost at the end of the lip.  Pause for a moment, then resume kissing as usual.\nDon't break out the biters too much.  They should be an occasional perk, not the main attraction.\nBe prepared for rejection.  Not everyone likes a side of teeth with their kisses.  If your partner doesn't respond well, try not to be too offended — it's probably a matter of personal taste, not a lapse in your technique."", ""11. Increase the intensity with occasional breaks.  Pull away for a moment to look into your partner's eyes, whisper something in his or her ear, or simply catch your breath and marvel at your good fortune.\nInstead of putting a damper on the action, these small moments can actually make kissing more intimate. It gives your partner the sense that you see him or her as a complete person, and not simply something to kiss."", ""1. Try to pick a trustworthy partner.  Smooching someone you trust can ease a lot of the anxiety of your first kiss.  If you knew you were giving someone his or her first kiss you'd try to be patient and understanding, so expect the same of your partner.\nKeep in mind that an awkward first kiss isn't the end of the relationship (or the world).  Actually, it can build intimacy through having a shared experience.  As long as you can laugh it off, you'll be fine.\nRemember, everyone has gone through having their first kiss.  Odds are that most people are more awkward about it than you'll be, even if you don't know it."", '2. Prepare your mouth.  Use chapstick or lipgloss to smooth over chapped lips, and brush your teeth and tongue well.  If your mouth feels a little stale, use breath mints or spray to freshen up.\nKnowing that your mouth is clean and appealing can help you feel more confident about kissing.\nThat being said, though, don\'t feel like you need to obsess over cleanliness.  Most mouths just ""taste"" warm, unless you\'ve recently eaten something pungent (like onions or garlic) or you\'ve just woken up in the morning.', '3. Don’t rush. You only get one first kiss! Unless you’re both so overwhelmed with desire that you have to kiss right now or the world will end, draw it out. It can be tremendously exciting and sensual to tease the kiss before it happens, keeping eye contact the whole time.', '4. Let the other person take the lead (optional).  If you\'re nervous about not knowing the right techniques, let your partner initiate what happens during the kiss.  Imitate what he or she does until you\'re comfortable trying your own moves.\n\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMoshe Ratson, MFT, PCC\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarriage & Family Therapist\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMoshe Ratson is the Executive Director of spiral2grow Marriage & Family Therapy, a coaching and therapy clinic in New York City.

Moshe Ratson, couples counselor, tells us: ""To show someone you\'re interested in kissing, try lowering your voice and leaning in slightly while you speak. You can even whisper into their ear.  Get physically closer than normal. Also consider mirroring your partner\'s body language.""', ""5. Take a few calculated risks.  As you become more comfortable with kissing, try to take the lead on initiating kisses or working on new techniques.  If your partner doesn't respond well, simply write it off as personal preference and try something else."", '1. Get close. Since the possibility of a goodbye kiss always beckons—and assuming it’s your desire—it’s best to start getting close sooner than later. Otherwise, you will find yourself saying your goodbyes with what feels like a chasm between you, making the swoop in for the kiss very conspicuous and awkward.\nGuys, this is when you get the dreaded last-minute-turn-and-kiss-on-the-cheek routine, which is second only to the phrase, “You remind me of my brother,” for most-deflating date ending. As you walk your date to the car, the door, etc., put your hand (or a jacket) on your date’s shoulder or back. This breaks the touch barrier, gently lets your date know your intentions, and gives you an excuse to stand very close all at the same time.', '2. Watch your date’s reaction. If your date angles his or her body away from you or speeds up to create distance, don’t try to complete the goodnight kiss—and don’t let your ego make a fool of you. Simply flash a big smile, thank them for the lovely time, and go about your business. It could simply be that your date isn’t ready to kiss yet.', '3. Maintain eye contact. Making eye contact while standing close is a universally acknowledged indicator that a post-date kiss is about to take place.\nIf the eye contact becomes too long, break and reestablish it as necessary; it’s better to let your eyes dart around than subject your date to an interrogation-style stare down. One good way to break eye contact while maintaining the romance is to glance down at your date’s lips\nIt may feel awkward to make your desires so clear, just remember that by giving your date a heads-up, you will make the kiss go much more smoothly and improve the odds that it will turn into a glorious make out session. Trying to plant a kiss by surprise, on the other hand, may result in bumped noses and teeth, a startled pullback, and much awkwardness.', '4. Stop the conversation. When people get nervous, they often compensate by finding anything to talk about, killing the kissing opportunities.\nWhile you shouldn’t try to end the conversation abruptly, which might come across as trying to get over with your goodbyes, you shouldn’t encourage your date to ramble, either.\nLet the chatter die down by keeping your responses friendly but minimal.', ""5. Consider breaking the kiss barrier. If everything is going well but you’re not quite ready to dive into full-blown romantic kissing, lean in for a hug and kiss the person on the cheek.\nDon’t confuse this with a friendly peck smack in the middle the cheek; make your feelings clear by placing the kiss close to the ear or mouth and letting your lips linger for a second, or whisper something flirty in their ear with lips touching. This will help the other person know that the kiss isn't meant in a platonic context."", ""6. Keep it simple. If this is a first kiss with this person—or, more importantly still, a first date—don’t overdo it. Keep your lips softly parted and either plant a straightforward kiss on your partner’s lips or up the ante by gently locking lips.\nResist the temptation to kiss hard or with tongue, unless you've been chasing this person for quite some time.  It might seem too forward and shut down future opportunities."", '7. Follow your date’s lead. Pay attention to how your date responds and moves during the kiss. If they lean closer or linger, you may be able to transition into more romantic kissing; otherwise, end the kiss by pulling slowly back, reopening your eyes to make eye contact, and smiling.', '1. Pucker your lips. Having your lips puckered keeps them tight and somewhat closed, indicating that you\'re unwilling to open your mouth for more intimacy. Most people will read a pucker as strictly platonic.\nTo know if you\'re puckering your lips correctly, kiss in the air. How loud is the kissing noise? It should be a clearly audible ""pop"" of your lips as you part them while sucking air in. A romantic kiss will barely make this noise because your lips are much more relaxed.', ""2. Make your intentions clear. If you want to kiss someone on the cheek and that someone is at risk of misinterpreting your intentions, make it clear that you're not going for the mouth by turning your head off to the side before you lean in. Try to plant the kiss squarely in the middle of the cheek so that it's not veering for more romantic areas such as the ear or mouth.\nIf you're uncomfortable actually kissing the other person's skin, try air kissing. Lean in so that your cheek is touching the side of the other person's cheek, and kiss the air with a few quick and audible puckers. For extra effect, pull back, switch sides, and do it again."", ""3. Keep it brief. The amount of time your lips spend on the other person's cheek or lips should be limited to whatever it takes to make that kissing noise described in the previous step—nothing more. If your lips linger, it won't seem so platonic."", ""4. Kiss out of respect or worship.  Bow or kneel before the other person. Look up in respect. Remain in this position during the kiss.  Take the person's hand gently and bring it close to your lips.""]"
Food and Entertaining,"[""1. Turn up the temperature. Yeast loves nothing better than a warm, moist climate to live its yeasty life to the fullest. If you want your dough to rise, you need to give the yeast what it wants.\nFill a baking pan with boiling water, and set it on the lowest rack in your oven. Place the container of dough on the middle rack, and close the oven door and allow the dough to rise.\nAlternately, you can boil a cup of water in the microwave, then place the container of dough in the microwave with the water, and close the door. (Don't microwave the dough!)\nSome people turn on the oven, and place the dough on top of the stove, covered with a damp towel. The oven keeps the surface of the stove warm, and the damp towel provides the moisture."", ""2. Add more yeast. If warm and moist isn't activating the yeast (you'll know in less than an hour), you can try adding more yeast.\nOpen a new package of yeast, and mix teaspoon of yeast with 1 cup (240ml) of warm water (at about 110°F/43°C) and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Let this mixture proof for about 10 minutes, until it gets 1/2- to 1-inch of foam. If this fails, you will need to get fresh yeast and try again.\nWhile proofing this yeast mixture, gently warm the flat dough to about 100°F (38°C) by placing the bowl in a warm place."", '3. Blend in the starter. Adding more flour as necessary: a ratio of 60% flour to 40% liquid is usually a good ratio for bread doughs so add sufficient flour needed to balance. Knead the active yeast mixture into the dough, then let it rise in a warm, moist place.\nThis can also be an indicator to see if your yeast is not active. This method makes the yeast very active so when it is added to the dough, it should rise perfectly. If your dough still fails to rise, it will indicate the yeast is not at fault: there is another problem.\nYou can also do this at the beginning of the recipe next time you make a different yeast dough.', '4. Knead in more flour. Check whether the dough is sticky to the touch. If so, this is probably under-kneaded dough. Knead in additional flour until smooth and silky to the touch and dough no longer sticks to your hand. Let rest and rise in warm wet environment. Repeat if needed. You may need  to let dough rest overnight before shaping and baking.', ""5. Knead the dough properly. There's an art to kneading. Too little, and you may not distribute the yeast through the dough. The dough will then be too weak to be able to rise. Too much kneading may make the dough so tough that it cannot expand. The dough should feel smooth and elastic, not tight like a rubber ball, or soft like biscuit dough."", '1. Find the problem. Consider several of the following points to do some preliminary diagnosis. It may be that a simple correction to the environment can fix the problem with no further effort.\nCheck the dough and yeast type. Some sourdough cultures are very slow rising and may need several hours to rise. A\nMake sure the yeast is still within its expiration date.Powdered yeast in packets last a long time, as does storing jars of dry yeast in the freezer. However, both fresh and dried yeast have a lifespan after which they will function weakly, or not at all.', '2. Check the environment. The ideal temperature is approx 100°F (38°C) and high humidity. Move too far out of that range, and your yeast will not be happy.', '3. Check the flour types. Breads made with cake or all-purpose flour, have low gluten and protein contents, so your dough may rise—and then collapse.\nThis can also happen if you have a dough that has too high a ratio of water to flour.\nSome flours contain antifungal ingredients to prolong shelf life. As yeast is a proud member of the Fungi kingdom, this will most definitely inhibit growth.\nOrganic, additive-free unbleached white bread flour works best for a good loaf of white bread.\nHeavier flours such as whole wheat, rye and other types of whole-grain flour will result in a heavy loaf that does not rise as much as fine white bread flour.', '4. Let the dough rest. Do not disturb the dough while it is rising, especially if it is a particularly wet dough.', ""5. Use the proper container. The pan, banneton, or tray you use will make a difference. Too large, and the dough has nothing to push against when rising, so won't rise upwards. Instead, it will spread and possibly collapse.\nSmall buns do well placed fairly close together."", ""6. Check your ingredients. Some spices, such as cinnamon, are naturally anti-fungal.\nFor sweet fruit buns or cinnamon rolls, you usually want a fast rise, as the cinnamon will eventually kill the yeast off.\nSome dried fruits also are coated with antifungals as a preservative. Organic dried fruits are expensive but much better for baking. What many bakers do is use standard dried fruit but don't add it till the final proofing."", '7. Ease up on the salt. Salt is a required ingredient for developing the gluten proteins that make for a smooth elastic dough, but too much will kill the yeast. Add only the required amount, and add it to the flour, not the water, at the beginning.']"

You can now send the screenshot by email or put it on a website.\nPNG is the default format in Windows 7 and 8. It\'s a lossless compressed format, which means that it will take high-quality screenshots at a small file size. It is the recommended format for taking screenshots.\nJPG or JPEG is the default format in Windows Vista. It is a lossy format, meaning that the screenshot will look slightly blocky and some colors may be a bit off. It\'s mainly designed for photographs, and not recommended for screenshots.\nGIF is unsuitable for reproducing color photographs, but well-suited for images such as graphics or logos with solid areas of color, resulting in crystal sharp edges between color areas.', '7. Copy the Snip. By default, the Snip is copied to the clipboard when you create it. This means you can paste it into Paint or Word, much like you would with a full-screen screenshot.

Personal Care and Style,"['1. Wear disposable gloves to prevent staining your hands. If you’re not careful, you’ll be left with hands that match your hair color! To avoid this, slip on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves or disposable latex gloves to keep the dye from soaking into your skin.\nIf you do stain part of your skin, there are a few ways to remove the Kool-Aid stains.', '2. Select your desired color of Kool-Aid. Choose your favorite color, or mix 2 together to create a custom color. Grape can create a lovely violet purple. Tropical punch creates a brighter red while cherry produces a deeper red. In the cooler spectrum, blue raspberry results in blue and lime creates a bright green. Mixed berry can result in a light blue.\nNote that the colors can appear differently on different hair types and base colors. For instance, grape Kool-Aid will leave a light pinkish violet on light blonde hair when left on for just 30 minutes. However, grape Kool-Aid will show up as a deep reddish purple on dark brown hair after 1 hour.\nIf you have brown hair, vibrant reds usually show up the best. You can also try deep purple and dark blue! You won’t be able to get a lighter color than your natural shade without first bleaching your hair, though.', '3. Empty 1 or more sugar-free Kool-Aid packet(s) into a small bowl. If you have very long hair, or if you want a heavily saturated hue, use 2 or more packets. The unsweetened version will be much less sticky than the artificially sweetened kind, enabling you to apply the dye more evenly and smoothly.\nIf you’re not sure how your hair will take to the dye, start with just 1 packet. You can always follow up with another dye session using a few more packets to build up the color.\nIf you’re mixing colors, stir together 2 packets. For instance, try black cherry mixed with strawberry for a vibrant red, or strawberry and grape for red-violet. You could also try blue raspberry and lemon-lime to create turquoise.', '4. Stir in hot water to dissolve the powder. Start by pouring 1 to 2 US tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of hot water into the bowl. Mix together the water and powder, stirring constantly with a spoon until the powder dissolves.\nA good rule of thumb is to use 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of water per packet of Kool-Aid.\nTry not to add too much water, or else the mixture will get too runny to paint onto your hair.', '5. Add hair conditioner to the mixture to form a creamy paste. Once the Kool-Aid is completely dissolved, squeeze a dollop of hair conditioner into the bowl and mix it in. Start with ⁄4  c (59 mL) of conditioner and adjust the measurements until a creamy paste forms.\nThe creamy consistency of your dye paste will make the dye easier to handle and apply to your hair. Plus the conditioner will help the dye spread through your hair.', '6. Cover your shoulders and workspace with an old towel. The dye will stain your clothes, so keep yourself protected with an old towel or t-shirt that you don’t mind getting stained. Consider wrapping a large garbage bag around your shoulders and clipping it in place to keep any moisture from getting through.\nAlso protect your workspace with another towel or garbage bag in case any dye drips onto your chair, the table, or the floor.', '1. Divide your hair into 3 to 6 sections. Start with clean, dry hair and use clips or hair ties to pull back parts of your hair. For even coverage, divide your hair into multiple smaller sections which you’ll apply the dye to.\nTry dividing your hair vertically into left and right segments, and then dividing each of these into 3 horizontal sections (top, middle, and bottom).\nAlternatively, divide your hair into left, right, and center sections and work your way from side to side.\nOr, start by exposing the hair at the nape of your neck and piling the rest of your hair up at your crown. Pull out small sections as you work your way from your nape up to your crown.', '2. Paint the Kool-Aid paste onto each section of hair, from the roots to the tips. Either use gloved hands or a hair dye brush to apply the dye paste onto your hair. Start with 1 section and massage or paint the dye into your roots. Then spread the dye down the strands, all the way to the tips, until the first section is completely coated.\nTie back each dyed section and proceed until all sections are evenly coated.\nAll of your hair must be saturated with dye otherwise the powder will just wash out, without coloring your hair.\nIf you’re dyeing your own hair, you might want to enlist the help of a friend. It can be hard to evenly coat the hair at the back of your head.', '3. Wrap your hair in saran wrap. Secure the hair at your crown with hair clips. Wind a few long sections of saran wrap around your hair to hold it in place, off of your face and shoulders. Alternatively, try a plastic grocery bag or resealable food storage bag. The plastic will help trap in the moisture and prevent the dye from spreading and staining.\nSecure the plastic wrap with tape for extra hold.\nThis step is especially useful if you plan to leave the dye on your hair for a few hours.', '4. Wait anywhere between 15 minutes and 5 hours for the desired saturation. If you have very light, fine hair and just want a subtle tint in your hair, leave the dye on for 15 or 30 minutes. But if you have darker or thicker hair, or if you want a deeply saturated dye job, wait a few hours before removing the dye.\nIf you’ve used more Kool-Aid packets, it’s ok to leave the dye on for a shorter amount of time.', '5. Rinse the Kool-Aid dye paste out of your hair with cold running water. Remove the saran wrap and turn on cool running water in a shower or sink. Rinse all of your hair, from the roots to the tips, under the water until all of the dye paste is washed out. Continue rinsing your hair until the water runs clear (or just a pale tint is left).\nIt may take between 10 and 20 minutes to get the water to run clear.\nWarm or hot water may more quickly wash out some of the pigment from your newly-dyed strands.\nDon’t use shampoo when you rinse out the dye. This could wash out and fade some of the color.', '6. Blow-dry or air-dry your freshly dyed hair to see the final results. Remove all the moisture from your hair, either with a hairdryer or by letting it dry naturally. Once your strands are completely dry, you’ll be able to see the final results of the Kool-Aid dye! Have fun styling and rocking your new ‘do.\nTo make your temporary color last as long as possible, wash your hair in cold water instead of hot water.\nIt’s ok to use warm water and heat styling tools, but keep in mind that the heat will cause the dye to fade faster.\nYou may need to experiment with the dye process a few times to get the balance right for your hair color. Just remember that if you have darker hair, the effects will be more subtle.', '1. Lay a piece of saran wrap or aluminum foil behind 1 section of hair. When you’re ready to start dyeing your clean and dry hair, lift up a small section of hair and lay a rectangular piece of saran wrap or foil behind it. Place the wrap or foil right at the root of your hair and use your hand to support it from behind.\nThink about how many streaks you want to add to your hair, and cut out 1 piece of saran wrap or foil for each streak before you get started.\nIf you’re creating narrow highlights, try picking up and painting a few thin strands on the same piece of saran wrap or foil.', '2. Use a highlighting brush to paint 1 in (2.5 cm) sections of hair with Kool-Aid dye. Pick up a dollop of the pre-mixed Kool-Aid dye paste with the brush and apply it directly to your hair. Brush it on, working from the roots to the tips, until the whole section is covered.\nSupport the strands from behind with your hand that’s beneath the piece of saran wrap or foil.', '3. Fold the piece of saran wrap or foil around the dye-coated strand. To prevent the dye from getting onto other parts of your hair, fold the saran wrap or foil tightly around each dyed strand.\nIf your hair is longer than the piece of wrap or foil, fold up the tips of your hair into a little bundle close to your roots before folding up the foil.', '4. Secure each wrapped section with a hair pin or hair tie. Once you’ve painted strand of hair and encased in saran wrap or foil, flip it up so it sits off of the under layers of hair. Slide on a hair pin onto the base or middle of the little packet of hair to secure it at your crown.\nIf you’re using saran wrap, try using a hair tie to create little bundles out of each section.', '5. Continue painting dye onto small sections of hair until you have enough streaks. The easiest way to add streaks is to start at your crown and pin back each foil-wrapped section as you work down your head.  Once you’ve completed as many streaks as you want, double-check that all the wrapped sections are secure.\nIf you have a lot of streaks, consider wrapping your hair in a plastic bag or with a few long pieces of saran wrap to hold them in place while you wait.', '6. Leave the dye on your hair for between 15 minutes and 5 hours. Depending on the natural color and thickness of your hair and the deepness of the color you want to achieve, leave the dye on for as long as you want.\nIf you want a really saturated hue, leave the dye on for 5 hours.\nIf you have light hair and you just want a light tint, don’t leave the dye on for longer than 1 hour.', '7. Rinse the dye out of your hair under cold running water. When you’re ready to rinse out the dye, unwrap each strand with gloved hands and discard the pieces of saran wrap or foil. Then use cool running water to rinse out your strands until the water runs clear.', '1. Add 3 to 4 unsweetened Kool-Aid packets to 2  c (470 mL) of hot water. Instead of making a creamy paste that you’ll paint onto your hair, you’ll create a dye bath in which you’ll dip the ends of your hair. Empty the Kool-Aid packets into a bowl of hot water and stir to dissolve the powder. Allow the water to cool slightly, for around 3 to 5 minutes.\nChoose whichever Kool-Aid color you want, or mix 2 together for a custom shade.\nUse more packets for more saturated color, especially if you have dark hair.', '2. Part your hair down the middle to create 2 pigtail sections. Make sure your hair is clean and dry before you dye it. As you’re waiting for the water to cool, divide your hair into 2 sections, a right and a left section. Put 1 section in front of each shoulder, and use a hair tie to secure each section into pigtails.', '3. Dip the ends of each pigtail into the dye bath. Keep your strands submerged in the bowl of Kool-Aid dye for about 15 to 30 minutes. If you have darker hair or want a deeper color, leave your hair in the dye bath longer. But if you have light or fine hair, 15 minutes might be enough to give your ends a bright pop of color.\nTry dipping your hair into the dye bath a few times for a deeper color. This also helps if you want to create a softer division between your dip-dyed ends and the rest of your hair.', '4. Scrunch your damp strands with a paper towel to remove the excess liquid. Once the time is up, pull your pigtails out of the dye bath and squeeze the excess liquid back into the bowl. Use a paper towel to squeeze the remaining moisture from your hair.\nMake sure you’re still wearing gloves during this process, as the Kool-Aid can stain your hands.', '5. Wrap the strands in a plastic bag if you want to let the dye soak in longer. For a richer color, or for darker hair, let the dye seep into your strands for a while longer. Use a hair tie to secure the plastic bag or a long strand of saran wrap around your dip-dyed ends. This will hold in some of the moisture while the dye permeates your hair. Keep this in place for up to 2 hours, or until your strands start to get dry.\nIf you want to leave the dye on for up to 5 hours, the method of painting on a dye paste containing hair conditioner would be a better choice.\nConditioner keeps the dye from drying out, whereas the dye bath liquid will evaporate after a short while.', '6. Rinse out your hair until the cool water runs clear. Without using any shampoo, rinse your hair thoroughly under cool water to remove all of the dye. Keep rinsing for about 10 or 20 minutes until the water runs clear, or very close to clear.\nOnce the dye is rinsed off, air-dry or blow-dry your hair to see the final results.']"
Personal Care and Style,"['1. Use the toilet first. The purpose of the bidet is to help clean off after toilet use. You can use the bidet in conjunction with toilet paper, or you can use the bidet on its own. Some people believe that using a bidet is a hygienic substitute for toilet paper, but many choose to use both.', ""2. Find the bidet. Sometimes, the bidet is located near the toilet, attached to the wall: it looks something like a low sink or a toilet with a faucet. However, many modern bidets are built into the toilet seat, so you don't need to get up to straddle another fixture.\nThere are three main types of bidet: the standalone bidets found in Europe, the handheld bidets found in some households, and the toilet seat bidets, embodied on the seat cover or fixed on back or side toilet rim, called add-on bidets, that are common in Asia.\nStandalone bidet: These bidets are separate fixtures which usually sit right next to the toilet. Sometimes, however, you'll find them across the room, or down the hall. Either way, you will need to use the toilet, then stand up and move over to the bidet. This is the original model of the bidet that originated in 18th-century Europe.\nAdd-on side-toilet rim or seat bidets: Many bathrooms in Asia and America don't have the space to accommodate a separate fixture next to the toilet – so many toilets are designed with built-in bidets or fixtures that fit over the toilet side rim or the seat. This way, you don't need to get up to clean yourself.\nHandheld bidet:  A bidet that hangs on the wall, and must be manually moved to the desired position to use."", ""3. Straddle a standalone bidet. On most standalone bidets, you can choose to face the bidet's water controls – or you can face away from them, as you would on a toilet. It is usually easier to control the temperature and flow of the water if you face the controls. You will be able to see the water as it comes out, so you might have a simpler time cleaning yourself.\nIf you are wearing pants, you may need to remove them to straddle the bidet facing the controls. If you don't want to completely take off your pants, try stepping out of one leg so that you can swing your legs around the bidet. In add-on bidets, things are much more straightforward. You have not to take off your pants.\nIn standalone bidets ultimately, the way you face may be dictated by the position of the jets, and which area of your body that you wish to clean. That is to say: if you need to clean your front, it might be easier to face the jets. If you're cleaning your rear, try facing away from the stream."", ""4. Activate a toilet seat bidet. Look for the “Wash” button on the bidet’s remote control, which is usually mounted on the wall next to the toilet. You may also find the button on the toilet itself. A nozzle will appear beneath you and rinse your nether regions with a stream of water.\nWhen you're done, simply press the “Stop” button. The nozzle will rinse itself off and retract back into the seat.\nIn mechanically controlled add-on bidets, you just turn the lever or pull a string and turn the mains valve."", ""1. Adjust the temperature and jet strengths for comfort.  If the bidet has both hot and cold water controls, start by turning on the hot water.  Once it's hot, add the cold water until you have a comfortable temperature. Be very careful when turning on the water, as many bidets can produce a very high jet of water with only a slight turn of the control. You may find that you need to hold the control to keep the jets on.\nIn normally hot climates, such as the Middle East, you should start with the cold water. The water will not need time to heat up, and you may end up burning sensitive areas if you turn the hot water on first.\nBe sure that you know where the water nozzle is, or you could end up with a surprise shower. If your bidet does have a spray nozzle set in the bowl (unlikely in the UK due to regulations), place your hand above it to subdue any jet of water and then either press or pull the diverter lever between or immediately behind the taps."", '2. Position yourself. Sit or squat over the stream so that the water hits the area you need to clean. You can continue to hover above the bidet, or you can sit down on it. Note that most bidets don\'t have seats, but are still meant to be sat upon; you just sit directly on the rim. Some bidets do not have jets: they simply have a faucet that fills the basin, much as you would fill a sink basin. In this latter case, you\'ll need to use your hands to manually clean yourself.\nWhen you use a mechanically handled bidet after you had finished the ""job"", you don\'t do more than use the external mechanism to turn the water jet nozzle to the center of the bowl and turn on the water supply valve, which is on your hands reach beside the bowl. On those bidet types, as the water jet is very thin, you don\'t usually feel the water temperature. Of course, in some cases you can use warm water, taking the water from the bath\'s supply.', '3. Clean your rear and/or your genitals. If you\'re using a bidet with a jet, then you can mostly let the force of the water do its work. If you\'re using a basin, then you\'ll need to get your hands dirty. Either way, you might consider using your wet hands to ""scrub"" the area clean more quickly. You can always wash your hands afterwards!\nConsider combining the bidet with toilet paper. You can use the paper at the end, to finish the job, or you can dampen the toilet paper in the water and use it to wipe yourself clean.', '1. Dry your skin. Some bidets have a built-in air dryer that you can use. Look for the ""Dry"" button next to the ""Wash"" and ""Stop"" features. If there\'s no air dryer, simply pat yourself dry with toilet paper. Many bidets have a towel on a ring positioned next to the bidet. This is meant for drying the genitals or the hands, but sometimes it is used for mopping up any splashes around the rim after rinsing it.', ""2. Rinse out the bidet.  Once you are off the bidet, run the jets at very low pressure for a few seconds to rinse the basin and keep the bidet fresh. This is a matter of discretion and common courtesy.\nMake sure to turn off the jets before you leave the bathroom. If you run the stream, you'll waste water."", ""3. Wash your hands. Use soap and water, as you would any time after using the toilet. If you can't find soap, use whatever's available.""]"
Food and Entertaining,"['1. Look for a change in color. When fresh, raw chicken has a pink, fleshy color. As it starts to spoil, the color fades to grey. If the color of the chicken begins to look duller, you should use it soon before it goes bad. Once it looks more grey than pink, it is already too late.\nRaw chicken colors can range from appearing grey to having yellow spots that aren’t skin.\nIf you begin to cook bad chicken it may continue to look dull and not become as white.', '2. Smell the chicken. Raw chicken that has gone bad has a very potent odor. Some describe it as a ""sour"" smell, while others liken it to the scent of ammonia. If the chicken has begun to take on an unpleasant or strong odor of any sort, it is best to discard it.\nChicken can start to smell bad while cooking, it is best to discard it if it starts to smell less appealing.', '3. Feel the chicken. Is it slimy? The touch test is a little more difficult than the color or smell test because chicken naturally has a glossy, somewhat slimy feeling to it. If this slime remains even after rinsing the chicken under water, however, there is a good chance that the chicken has spoiled. If the chicken feels unusually sticky, it has almost certainly gone bad.', '1. Look for an ice crust. If there is a thick layer of ice around your chicken then it is no longer good. The ice crust will be thick like the ice on a freezer hasn’t been thawed in a while.  A flash-frozen chicken will not have a thick crust if done properly. If the ice is white it could be an issue with freezer burn.', '2. Check for freezer burn. Freezer burn looks like a white rash or mark on the chicken that isn’t fat.  It is rougher than the skin around it and raised slightly.\nWhile it won’t hurt you it will make your chicken less enjoyable.', '3. Analyze the color.  A frozen chicken is harder to check for color.  It will be off color, similar to the raw or cooked chicken, a slight grey or yellowing of fat.  If it is darker than grey, that chicken belongs in the trash bin.', '1. Smell the chicken. The smell test can work for cooked chicken as well as it can for raw chicken, but it is sometimes more difficult to distinguish the smell of bad chicken if spices and other seasonings are masking the odor.\nIf the chicken smells like rotten eggs or sulfur, it is bad.', '2. Check for changes in color, if possible. Sometimes this is not possible if the chicken has been breaded or if the color was altered by a glaze or marinade. If chicken that cooked white begins to look grey, it is no longer safe to eat.', ""3. Look for mold. Mold is one of the most obvious signs of rotten, decaying, bad chicken. If green, or black fuzz, or any organic growth of any kind has begun to form on the chicken, it has gone very bad and should be discarded immediately. Even the smell of chicken this 'off' may make you ill."", '4. Taste the chicken before you swallow it. If you feel uncertain about whether or not cooked chicken is still good, but do not want to waste it if it still is, you can cautiously take a bite. Instead of chewing and swallowing the chicken immediately, though, you should pause and carefully analyze the flavor.\nIf it tastes “off” or seems a little sour, spit it out and discard the rest.', '1. Check the ""Sell By"" date. This alone is not always a good indication of whether or not raw chicken is still good because the ""Sell By"" date only dictates at which point chicken can no longer be sold to consumers. Instead of relying on the ""Sell By"" date, it is best to use it as a means of confirming whether or not chicken you suspect has gone bad is actually past its prime.\nIf you purchase fresh, refrigerated chicken from a store and freeze it, it can last up to nine months past this date, as long as it was fresh when purchased.', '2. Check into how thoroughly the chicken was stored. Cooked chicken goes bad faster if it is exposed to air, and improperly stored chicken is more likely to be bad.\nChicken should be stored in shallow, airtight containers or heavy-duty freezer bags.\nIt could also be wrapped tightly in aluminum foil or plastic wrap.\nExample: In order to remain safe to eat, the whole chicken should be cut into smaller portions and any stuffing should be removed prior to refrigeration or freezing.', '3. Find out where and for how long the chicken was stored. It depends also depends on how you stored the chicken.  After these time periods elapse, there is a higher chance that the chicken will have gone bad.\nIn the refrigerator, raw chicken should be used in one or two days, while cooked chicken stays good for about three to four days.\nIn the freezer, cooked chicken can remain good and safe to eat for up to four months while raw chicken can be good for up to a year.']"
Education and Communications,"['1. Write down the formula for finding the circumference of a circle using the diameter. The formula is simply this: C = πd. In this equation, ""C"" represents the circumference of the circle, and ""d"" represents its diameter. That is to say, you can find the circumference of a circle just by multiplying the diameter by pi. Plugging π into your calculator will give you its numerical value, which is a closer approximation of 3.14 or 22/7.', '2. Plug the given value of the diameter into the formula and solve.\nExample problem:  You have a circle tub with a diameter of 8 feet, and you want to build a white fence that creates a 6-foot wide space around the tub. To find the circumference of the fence that has to be created, you should first find the diameter of the tub and the fence which will be 8 feet + 6 feet + 6 feet, which will account for the entire diameter of the tub and fence. The diameter is 8 + 6 + 6, or 20 feet. Now plug it into the formula, plug π into your calculator for its numerical value, and solve for the circumference:\nC = πd\nC = π x 20\nC = 62.8 feet', '1. Write down the formula for finding the circumference of a circle using the radius. The radius is half as long as the diameter, so the diameter can be thought of as 2r. Keeping this in mind, you can write down the formula for finding the circumference of a circle given the radius: C = 2πr. In this formula, ""r"" represents the radius of the circle. Again, you can plug π into your calculator to get its numeral value, which is a closer approximation of 3.14.', ""2. Plug the given radius into the equation and solve. For this example, let's say you're cutting out a decorative strip of paper to wrap around the edge of a pie you've just made. The radius of the pie is 5 inches. To find the circumference that you need, just plug the radius into the equation:\nC = 2πr\nC = 2π x 5\nC = 10π\nC = 31.4 inches""]"
Finance and Business,"['1. Take items that you want to sell to a pawn shop. Your local pawn shop may pay you a decent price for high-value items, such as electronics, musical instruments, or jewelry. Take your items to the pawn shop and see what they are willing to give you for them. This is one way to make money without any money in hand.\nPawn shops resell your items to make money, so they may not give you as much as they are actually worth.', '2. Trade-in items for cash at second-hand stores. Some second-hand stores will also buy items, such as used clothing, CDs, DVDs, records, or books. Take some valuable items that are in good condition and see what you can get for them.These stores make money by reselling your items, so you might not get as much as they are actually worth.', '3. Have a yard sale to sell things you no longer need. Choose a day or a couple of days to have your yard sale. Advertise it in your local paper and online, such as on social media and classified websites. Then, on the day of the sale, arrange the items on tables, blankets, shelves, or in other ways in front of your home. You can arrange the items into groups by price, or price them individually.\nTry to put out as many valuable, high-demand items as you are willing to let go. Good items to sell include CDs, DVDs, books, musical instruments, collectible toys, electronic equipment (computers, tablets, televisions, speakers, etc.), smartphones, video games, jewelry, clothing, shoes, and unused gift cards.Tip: Make sure that you can have a yard sale in your area. Some homeowner’s associations restrict yard sales to certain times of year. If you rent, you may need to ask your landlord for permission to have a yard sale.', '4. Sell unwanted items using a commercial website. Some sites charge a small fee or take a percentage of the sales price, but the exposure is often worth this cost. Sell any items that you have around that are in good or new condition.\nTry using eBay or a similar website if you want to sell something auction-style. This may help you to get the most money for your item if it is rare or valuable.\nOnline retail sites like Amazon or AbeBooks.com will sometimes pay for popular items like books, DVDs, electronics, and smartphones. These sites may charge a small fee or percentage of your profit.', '5. Set up a lemonade stand. If you have enough money to buy some lemonade mix, a pitcher, and cups, then you can start a lemonade stand. Use a sturdy box or crate to set your items on, and make a sign with your price per cup on it.Make sure to use clean drinking water to make your lemonade, and add ice to it if possible!\nLemonade stands work best on a hot summer day. Set up your stand in your front yard and wait for customers to stop by.\nMake sure to ask permission from your parent or guardian before you set up a lemonade stand.', '6. Offer to do yard work in your neighborhood. You can also make money doing yard work, such as mowing lawns, aerating lawns, weeding, or raking up leaves. Make fliers advertising your services and post them around your neighborhood, or go door-to-door offering your services.Set a fair price for your services and do good work for anyone willing to pay you. Check to see what other people charge and set your rate a few dollars lower than that so to entice people to hire you.', '7. Rent out a room in your home to travelers. If you live in a city or a popular vacation spot, people passing through may be looking for a place to stay. Even if you don’t live somewhere with a lot of traffic, you can still use a rental website to find people who are willing to pay to stay in your home.Check to see what other people charge to help you price your rental . For example, if a similar-sized room in your area goes for $80 per night, then charge this amount for your room.', '1. Find small paid tasks via apps. There are apps that pay you for doing marketing tasks, such as scanning products at a grocery store or completing a survey. Download one of these apps and use it to find small paid tasks you can do.\nYou may not be able to make much money per task this way. However, you can start right away and make some money.Warning: Stay away from apps that ask you to do something like pay a fee or supply credit card information to sign up to complete surveys. Those are almost always scams.', '2. Fill out online surveys. There are many websites devoted that connect users to free online surveys. These usually only pay at most a few dollars each, but they take very little effort and may provide fast payment.\nAmazon’s Mechanical Turk program is another way to make money online by answering questions or completing simple tasks. However, the pay is usually very low, often only a few cents per task.', '3. Use your skills to do day labor. Post an ad online or on a bulletin board offering to do odd jobs or sign up with an employment agency that specializes in temporary work. You can also go where other day laborers meet and wait for employers, such as building contractors, landscapers, homeowners and small business owners. Common odd jobs people need day laborers for include:\nConstruction\nBasic office tasks\nYardwork (raking leaves, mowing lawns, shoveling snow, cleaning gutters, etc.)\nPicking up groceries or running other errands for the elderly\nDoing chores (cleaning houses, clearing out an attic or shed, etc.)\nWashing cars\nMoving and/or packing', '4. Try pet sitting if you enjoy spending time with animals. Find friends who are going out of town and offer to take care of their pets while they’re gone. Professional boarding places tend to be expensive, so your cozy little house or apartment is a nice alternative.\nCheck to see what other pet sitters in your area charge to help you set your rates. Around the holidays, pet-boarders fill up, meaning you can probably charge more.\nAsk your friends and family if they know anyone who needs a pet sitter. Word-of-mouth is often a great way to find jobs.', '5. Become a dog walker if you live in an area where they are in demand. You can walk dogs for people who own dogs but who are too busy to walk them. However, this can be a demanding job, especially if you end up walking a few dogs at once or if you are walking dogs throughout the day, so ensure that you have the physical stamina for this type of job.\nCheck to see what other dog walkers charge in your area and make your prices similar to those.\nMake a flyer or post an advertisement on online classifieds boards to advertise your services as a dog walker.\nTell friends and family you are looking for work as a dog walker.', '6. Become a babysitter if you are good with children. There are websites that will connect you with people who need a babysitter. To get hired by people who do not know you, it will help to pass a CPR class, or to have a special talent or expertise for entertaining children. However, you might be able to make money more quickly just by babysitting for people you know, or by having friends refer you to others who need a babysitter.\nCheck to see what babysitters charge in your area and make your rates comparable.\nKeep in mind that caring for children is often hard work. Make sure that this is something you enjoy doing!', '7. Sign up with a ride service company to become a private cab driver. Companies such as Uber, Grubhub and Lyft have set up services that connect drivers with people who need a ride and are willing to pay for it.  You must own a car, have a valid driver’s license, and meet other qualifications to be a driver.\nIt might take some time to get registered as a driver with the service, but once you are, there are opportunities to make money fast because these services are in high demand.', ""8. Showcase your talents as a street performer. If you can dance, play music, mime, sing, or tell jokes, you can probably get some cash by performing in public. Put together a good act and find a place to perform. Give people a dose of live entertainment, and hopefully they'll reward you with tips.\nMake sure to have a hat, cup, instrument case, or something else ready for people to drop money into.\nAlways check local laws before performing in a public space, since some areas have bans or restrictions on this kind of work."", '9. Pose for art students at a local art school or museum. Contact local art schools, colleges, and museums about opportunities to be a live model. Art students learn to draw the human figure by studying live models. Those that are willing to pose nude in front of others for up to 30 minutes can make money this way (usually at a per-hour rate).\nPeople hire models of all shapes, sizes, and genders.\nThe website Art Model Tips maintains lists of opportunities in each state.', '1. Return bottles and cans for a refund. In some states, you can get 5 or 10 cents per can or bottle by returning them to a deposit center. There are many ways to take advantage of this opportunity:\nScrounge up all of the cans and bottles you can find around your home.\nLook for cans and bottles in trash cans, along busy roads, and anywhere that people hang out (parks, stadiums, etc.).Tip: For a fun way to get some extra bottles and cans to recycle, host a bring-your-own-beverage party. When the party’s over, gather all the bottles and cans and turn them in for cash.', ""2. Scrap a junk pile for cash. If you've got a big pile of scrap in your backyard, own a junked camper or other vehicle, or know of a dump site where you can legally salvage materials, you can sort and sell it to a scrap yard or recycling center in your area. Metals such as scrap steel, copper, or aluminum can fetch good prices.\nIf your state doesn’t have a can/bottle refund system, you can still sell aluminum cans to a scrap yard."", '3. Sell a computer you no longer want or use. Computers are full of valuable metals such as steel, aluminum, and gold. If you dismantle old computers, you can sort these metals and sell them to a salvage yard, or you may be able to find buyers who will accept the old computer as is and scrap it themselves.\nIf possible, get several computers to scrap to make it worth your while. For instance, offer to take outdated computers from a school doing upgrades or find junked computers.\nDon’t scrap good, working computers; what you get for the scrap won’t be as much as you could get by selling the components or the entire device.', '1. Borrow money from a friend or family member. If you’re in serious need of money, you can always ask to borrow some from family or friends. Let them know why you need to borrow money, and offer to pay it back within a certain (feasible) timeframe.\nWarning: Beware of loan sharks or other extortionists. Look for people that can loan you money because they want to help you, not because they want to make a profit.', '2. Use your bank’s overdraft protection if you need to make a purchase. If you have a checking or other account with overdraft protection, you might be able to overdraw on the account and take advantage of the temporary payment, when you are in need of quick cash. The bank will cover the cost, but you will have to pay it back.\nThis is a last resort option since you will likely incur fees as a result of overdrawing your account.', '3. Use your credit card’s cash advance feature. Some credit cards will allow you to withdraw a certain amount of cash by using it at an ATM. This can help you come up with cash in a hurry. However, the interest rates on cash advances are usually much higher than the credit card’s usual interest rate, meaning that you will eventually have to pay more.\nSome credit cards also allow you to use cash advances by writing checks. The interest rates for these are sometimes lower; check with your bank or credit card issuer for details.', '4. Seek a payday loan or title loan as a last resort. Companies that offer payday and title loan services offer high interest rates (sometimes with percentages in the hundreds). If you cannot pay the loan and any interest back within the stated timeline, you risk even higher interest costs or, in the case of a title loan, the loss of your car. Avoid these types of loans in all but the direst circumstances, unless you are certain you will be able to pay the loan back. \nAs an alternative, you might be able to ask your employer for a payday advance.']"
Home and Garden,"[""1. Pick out a fresh pineapple. Look for one with firm, green leaves that have not turned yellow or brown. The skin on the fruit should be golden brown and firm to the touch. Smell the pineapple to see if it's ripe: it should emit sweet, heady smell indicating that you've chosen it at just the right time to start a new pineapple plant.\nMake sure the pineapple isn't underripe. It needs to be ripe in order to produce another pineapple.\nCheck to make sure the pineapple isn't too ripe by tugging a little at the leaves. If they come right off, the pineapple is too ripe to plant. Be gentle.\nMake sure the pineapple doesn't have scale insects around the base of the leaves. They look like small grayish black spots."", ""2. Twist the leaves off the top of the pineapple. Grasp the body of the pineapple with one hand and use the other to grab the leaves at the base and twist them off. This method ensures that the base of the leaves will stay intact. It will be attached to a minimum amount of fruit, which you don't need in order for the plant to grow.\nIf you're having trouble twisting off the top, you can slice off the top of the pineapple. Slice off the excess fruit around the root.\nMake sure the base, the very tip of the area where the leaves join together, stays intact. New roots will be sprouting from this, and without it the plant won't grow."", '3. Strip off some of the lower leaves to expose the stem. This helps the stem sprout roots once it is planted. Strip until a few inches of the stem are exposed. Cut away any remaining fruit without damaging the stem.', '4. Turn it upside down and let it dry for a week. The scars where you made a cut and removed the leaves will harden, which is necessary before you take the next step.\nAt this point, you can plant the crown into the soil, if you would like. While some people prefer to soak the pineapple crown first, it is not necessary.', '1. Fill a large glass with water. The mouth of the glass should be large enough to fit the pineapple crown inside, but small enough so that you can prop it up to keep it from getting completely submerged.', ""2. Stick a few toothpicks into the pineapple crown. Place them across from each other near the top of the stem. Push them in just far enough so that they'll stay in place. These toothpicks are used to suspend the pineapple crown in the glass of water."", '3. Put the crown in the water. The toothpicks should rest on the rim of the glass. The stem should be submerged in the water, and the leaves should stick out the top.', ""4. Place the glass in a sunny window and wait for the roots to sprout. It should take several days or up to a few weeks for white roots to poke out and begin to grow.\nKeep the plant away from extreme temperatures. Don't let it get too hot or too cold.\nChange out the water every few days to prevent the growth of mold."", '1. Prepare a pot of soil for the crown. Fill a 6-inch pot with light garden soil that has a 30% blend of organic matter. This has the right blend of nutrients for the pineapple plant.', ""2. Plant the pineapple crown in the pot. Plant the crown when the roots are a few inches long. Wait until they've gotten long enough to take root in soil. If you plant the crown too early it won't do well. As you plant it, make sure that the base of any remaining leaves are just above soil level. Press the soil firmly around the base of the crown without  getting any soil on the leaves."", ""3. Keep the plant moist and warm. It needs a sunny, warm and humid environment where the night temperatures won't drop below 65ºF (18ºC). If conditions are dry, mist the plant regularly.\nYou can keep the pot outside if you live in a warm climate. If you have cool winters take it indoors during the winter season and keep it in a sunny window. It's important for the plant to get a lot of sun all year round.\nTo help the rooting process, you can slip a plastic bag over the top of the pot. This will create a mini-greenhouse effect."", '4. Give the plant food and water. Water the soil lightly once a week.  Fertilize the plant with half-strength fertilizer twice a month during the summer.', '5. Look for flowers. It can take several years, but eventually a red cone should appear from the center of the leaves, followed by blue flowers and eventually a fruit. It takes about six months for the fruit to fully develop. The pineapple will grow from the flower, above ground, in the center of the plant.']"
Food and Entertaining,"['1. Use materials safe for consumption. You should only use food grade plastic buckets or glass carboys as your fermentation vessel. Make sure that the lid is food grade as well. A 7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel will allow for 5.5 to 6 gallon (21 to 23 L) batches.  Keep in mind that you may occasionally need to stir the batch, so containers such as buckets are often ideal.', '2. Leave extra room. You need about 1.5 to 2 gallons (5.7 to 7.6 L) worth of space in a 7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel. This allows room for the foam and gases that form during fermentation. If you don’t leave enough room, the pressure can build and pop the lid on the vessel, leading to contamination.', '3. Prepare the lid. You need to make a hole in the lid that is the right size for a rubber grommet and airlock. Push the grommet into the hole. Then fit the airlock into the top of the grommet. Install a rubber gasket around the lip of the lid to form an airtight seal between the lid and the container.', '4. Clean and/or sanitize the equipment. The fermentation vessel (and rubber stopper for glass vessels or lid for a plastic bucket), airlock, and a large spoon should be cleaned and sanitized. Fill the fermentation vessel to the brim with a sanitizer, such as iodophor, that is made for brewing and  winemaking. All these items are available at homebrewing and wine-making shops.', '1. Determine how much sugar (sucrose) to use. More sugar will result in more alcohol as long as the yeast can process it all. If you want a weaker batch (less alcohol) you can use less sugar. As a general guide, each packet of yeast will have directions that indicate how much sugar can be used.\nIf making two batches, be sure to use twice as much yeast (two packets).', '2. Dissolve the sugar. Mix the sugar into a pot of warm water to dissolve it. You can use tap water or bottled water. The water should be about 90 °F (32 °C). Use roughly 7 to 9 kilograms (15 to 20 lb) of sugar.\nFor a cleaner alcohol, use purified water.', '3. Pour the sugar solution into the vessel.  When all of the sugar has been dissolved, carefully pour the sugar and water solution into the plastic bucket or glass carboy that you are using as a fermentation vessel. For a  7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel, pour 1.5 to 2 gallons (5.7 to 7.6 L) of solution. This sugar will be broken down by the yeast to produce alcohol.\nIt is not necessary to sterilize the sucrose solution before fermenting, but if desired this can be done by boiling the sucrose solution for fifteen to twenty minutes. Take into account that some of the water will evaporate, so add a little more water before boiling.', '4. Add the yeast. Open the yeast packet and dump the yeast into the sugar water solution. If using a plastic bucket, stir to get an even mixture. Use a sanitized, dry funnel to help prevent a mess when adding the yeast to the narrow opening of a carboy.\nUse one packet of yeast. More yeast can speed up the process, but it will not lead to a better yield of alcohol.\nDo not put the yeast into the sugar water until it has cooled.  If the water is too hot it will kill the yeast.', '5. Wait one day. In the first days of fermentation, the yeast will expend most of its energy multiplying itself. Since this process requires oxygen, leave the lid off for the first 24 hours. If you cut off oxygen to the yeast immediately, the fermentation process will take much longer and may proceed sluggishly.', '6. Affix the lid to the bucket. If using a plastic bucket, tightly push the lid onto the bucket so that an airtight seal is formed. This may be somewhat difficult and may require some leverage. An airtight seal is necessary for proper fermentation.\nFermentation is an anaerobic (lacking oxygen) process.', '7. Add water to the airlock. If you haven’t already, push the airlock into the lid if using a plastic bucket. If using a carboy, now is the time to push the airlock through a drilled rubber stopper and fit the stopper snugly in the mouth of the carboy. Add clean water or vodka to the inside of the airlock so that carbon dioxide can be released from the fermenting solution while air is kept out. The drop in available oxygen will cause the yeast to stop multiplying and start producing ethanol and carbon dioxide.', '8. Let the mixture ferment. Keep the ambient temperature 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C). This temperature will promote optimum performance from the yeast. It should take about two to ten days for the yeast to produce alcohol. The time required will vary depending on the type of yeast used, and on how much sugar was added. It will take longer to completely ferment more sucrose.', '9. Stop the process. The airlock will bubble a lot during active fermentation. The bubbling will slow as fermentation slows, and stop completely when all or most of the sucrose has been fermented. If you are unsure, leave the batch for another day or two. Once the fermentation is over, it is time to purify the alcohol.', ""1. Clarify the fermented alcoholic liquid. After fermentation is complete, use a fining agent such as isinglass to remove suspended yeast and other material that may be present. Try to find isinglass that doesn't contain sulphites, as some people are allergic to sulphites. After adding the finings, reseal the fermenter with the lid or stopper and the airlock and allow the liquid to clarify for two or three days.\nUse 0.5 to 1.0 gram of isinglass per 5 gallons (19 L) of batch."", ""2. Siphon or pour off the alcoholic liquid. Siphon or carefully pour off the liquid into a glass carboy or other airtight container such as a cornelius keg. Leave the unwanted sediment behind in the fermentation vessel. You can also pour the liquid through a pad or membrane filter, such as a wine filter, to further clarify the liquid and remove residual yeast. Bottle the alcohol to preserve it.\nDon't store the alcoholic liquid in a carboy for more than a month as it can become oxidized over time.\nFilter through a carbon filter if desired. Use a food-grade carbon filter to remove unwanted volatiles to further purify the alcohol. If flavors were added before this point, don't use the carbon filter because it will most likely strip out the flavors."", '3. Drink responsibly. Add your alcohol directly to jungle juice or add liqueur flavorings. You can also age the alcohol in sealed bottles to improve the flavor, especially if making liqueurs. New bottles can be found at home brewing shops.\nReuse liquor bottles, wine bottles, and beer bottles, or use mason jars.']"
Health,"['1. Remove the Aloe vera plant from its current pot. One of the typical reasons for Aloe vera plant death is root rot. In order to determine if this is the case, you need to first take the plant out of its pot.\nLoosely hold the base of the plant and the bottom of your pot. Tip the pot upside down, and continue holding the plant with your other hand. Hit the bottom of the pot with your hand or knock it against a table ledge (or other hard surface).\nDepending on the size of your plant, you may need another person to help you. One person should hold the plant base with both hands, while the other person tips the pot upside down and hits the bottom.. You might also find it helpful to jostle the pot back and forth until the plant comes loose.\nIf you still have difficulties removing your plant with two sets of hands, you can run a trowel or knife around the interior of the pot and try releasing it again, or push some of the soil out through the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. If your plant still does not come out of the pot, you may need to break your pot, but this is a last resort.\nWhile releasing the Aloe Vera plant from its pot, be sure that you are keeping the plant itself as steady as possible. All the movement should be centered on the pot, not the plant itself. In other words, hold, don’t pull, the plant. Hitting the bottom of the pot will keep your roots intact, and gravity will push the plant downward.', '2. Tend the roots. Examine the roots and determine how many of the roots are still healthy. Mushy roots are characteristic of root rot and need to be removed. Any roots that aren’t black or mushy are good and can be kept.\nIf you see a lot of healthy roots and only a section of dead or mushy roots, you can likely save your plant without too much trouble, but you’ll need to cut away the damaged roots. You can use a sharp, sterilized knife to cut away the dead roots, but make sure to get them all.\nIf you notice that the majority of your plant has damaged roots, it will take a little more effort to save the plant, and it may be beyond saving. In this case, you can try to save the plant by removing the largest leaves (with a knife). Cut away about half of the plant. This method is risky. However, with fewer leaves to nourish, the small amount of undamaged roots can better direct nutrients throughout the plant.', '3. Choose a pot that is one-third larger than the root system. Any excess soil will hold water and could cause root rot in the future, so a smaller pot is better than a larger one.\nThe roots of Aloe vera plants grow horizontally, rather than vertically.  Aloe vera plants can also become quite heavy, and the weight of the plant can cause a narrow pot to tip over. Thus, select a wide pot, rather than a deep or narrow pot.\nThe pot you choose should also have plenty of drainage holes on the bottom so that excess water does not sit in the soil.\nA plastic pot is best if you live in a dryer climate, while a pot made from terra cotta or clay is best for cooler or humid areas.', '4. Use potting soil suitable for cactus or succulents. This type of soil has a higher sand content and produces a well-draining environment for your plant. You can find this type of soil easily at your local garden center. \nYou can also create your own soil mix for your Aloe vera plant by mixing equal parts of sand, gravel or pumice, and soil. Be sure to use a coarse sand (like builder’s sand), rather than a fine sand. Fine sand can clump and hold water, rather than allowing it to drain down and through the pot.\nAlthough you can use potting soil for Aloe vera plants, they will thrive better in a mixed soil. Potting soil is more likely to hold moisture and could therefore cause root rot.', ""5. Replant your Aloe vera. Prepare the pot by filling it with the potting soil mixture, and shake your Aloe vera plant gently to remove about a third of the soil that has attached itself to the root ball. Place your plant in the newly prepared pot and cover the top with more of the potting soil mixture. Be sure that the entire root ball is covered with the soil mixture , but don't bury the plant deeper than it was in the first pot. \nYou can also layer small rocks or gravel on the top of the soil, which helps reduce the evaporation of water."", '6. Do not water immediately after repotting. Your Aloe vera plant needs a few days to readjust to its new pot and to repair any broken roots.', '1. Check the soil. You can tell if your Aloe vera plant needs to be watered by pressing your index finger a few inches down into the soil. If the soil is dry, your plant needs water. Aloe vera plants are succulents and do not need to be watered often. Overwatering can kill your plant! \nIf you keep your plant outside, watering every two weeks should be sufficient.\nIf you keep your plant inside, water it every three to four weeks.', '2. Modify watering according to the season. Aloe vera plants need more water in the warmer months, but less in the cooler months. Water less often in Fall and Winter, especially if your plant lives in a cool space.', '3. Examine the leaves. As a succulent, Aloe vera plants store water in their leaves. If you notice the leaves are dropping or are becoming almost transparent, your plant likely needs water.\nHowever, the same qualities can be a sign of root rot, caused by overwatering. Ask yourself when you watered your plant last. If you watered it recently, you should remove the plant from the pot and check for root rot.', '4. Water until the soil is just moist. Water should never sit on top of the surface of the soil, so water with a light hand. Continue to check your plant weekly or bi-weekly by testing the soil to see if it needs to be watered.', '1. Check the leaves. If the leaves of your Aloe vera plant are turning brown or red, your plant may be sunburned.', '2. Reposition your plant. Move your plant to a place where it receives indirect, rather than direct, sunlight.\nIf your plant is typically in a position to receive artificial light rather than sunlight, reposition the plant so that there is a greater distance between it and the light source. You can also try moving it outside so that it is getting some indirect natural light, rather than artificial light.', '3. Water your plant. Check the soil and determine if your plant needs to be watered. The soil is likely dry if your plant has been getting too much sunlight, since the water would be evaporating more quickly.', '4. Remove dead leaves. With a sharp, sterilized knife, cut the leaf away from the plant at the base. Any leaves that are dead take nutrients from other parts of the plant, so be sure to remove them so that the rest of your plant doesn’t suffer.']"

Health,"[""1. Gather your ingredients. This sanitizer closely emulates the commercial kind, without all the chemicals and without the bad smell. Hand sanitizer should not replace hand washing; just use it when you really need it. Here's what you'll need:\n2/3 cup 99% rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) or 190-proof grain alcohol (Do not substitute other concentrations of alcohol.)\n1/3 cup pure aloe vera gel (preferably without additives)\n8 to 10 drops essential oil, such as lavender, clove, cinnamon, or peppermint\nMixing bowl\nSpoon\nFunnel\nPlastic container"", '2. Mix the alcohol and aloe vera gel in the bowl. Pour the ingredients into the bowl and use the spoon to mix them together well. The mixture should be completely smooth.\nIf you want the solution to be thicker, add another spoonful of aloe vera.\nOr thin it out by adding another spoonful of alcohol.', '3. Add the essential oil. Add it one drop at a time, stirring as you go. After about 8 drops, smell the mixture to see whether you like the scent. If it seems strong enough, stop there. If you like a stronger scent, add a few more drops.\nUse whatever scent you enjoy. Lavender, clove, cinnamon, peppermint, cinnamon, lemon, grapefruit and passion fruit all work well.', ""4. Funnel the mixture into the container. Place the funnel over the mouth of the container and pour the hand sanitizer in.

Sports and Fitness,"[""1. Use a milk jug. Fill a clean, plastic gallon jug with water, sand, rocks, or concrete. Make sure that the jug has a handle; you will use this to complete your exercise reps. Use the handles to lift and lower the jug like you would any hand weight or dumbbell.\nWith milk jug hand weights, you can do bicep curls, tricep exercises, bent-over rows, pec flyes, deadlifts, and shoulder raises.\nYou can also hold these weights to your sides when you are doing squats or lunges.\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaila Ajani\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFitness Trainer\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaila Ajani is a Fitness Trainer and founder of Push Personal Fitness, a personal training organization based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Lift canned goods. Canned goods that fit into your hands work well as simple hand weights. This is especially good if you are starting out and trying to build muscles slowly. Use larger canned goods as heavier weights or medicine balls.', '3. Make dumbbells from plastic water bottles. Instead of recycling your plastic water and soda bottles, refill them with water, or put pebbles or sand in them instead. When filling them, make sure to weigh them so the weights are the same for both hands. Lift the bottles like you would any dumbbell.', ""4. Make arm weights with water bottles. Instead of using the water bottles for hand weights, this method attaches multiple bottles to your arms like wrist weights. Before you put them on your arms, fill them with sand. For heavier weights, add water after you fill them completely with sand.\nWhen they are filled, scotch tape the plastic bottles all the way around your forearm. The tape does not touch your skin; it only touches the bottles to hold them together. You can also use duct tape, just don't attach it to your skin. Place the bottles just tight enough so they do not slide off your arms."", ""5. Make a weighted medicine ball from a basketball. Take an old basketball and drill a hole into one of the black stripes. The hole should be big enough to funnel in the weighted material. Place a funnel in the hole and fill with sand or pebbles until you have achieved the desired weight. Use a bike tire patch kit to fill the hole. You can also use duct tape if you don't have a tire patch kit. The repurposed ball can now be used just like a medicine ball."", ""6. Make wrist weights from socks. Fill a clean sock with dry beans. Alternately, use pebbles or small craft rocks for a heavier weight. Sew or glue the open end of the sock closed. Then, sew the ends together, or sew Velcro onto the ends so you can remove it easily.\nUse a scale to adjust the weight. Fill the sock as full as you want based on weight and then cut the excess fabric. If you want to make heavier weights but the inside material won't fit, use a larger sock.\nWhen choosing a sock, make sure to choose one long enough to wrap around your wrist. If the sock is too long, fill it until it will wrap around your wrist, then cut the excess fabric before closing the end."", '7. Use packets of rice or beans. These packages are great for mini-weights if you are a beginner. You can use them right from the cabinet for bicep curls and other small weight-lifting moves.', '8. Cut bicycle tire tubes into hand weights. Take a bicycle inner tube and cut it into equal lengths. Secure one end of the tube with duct tape, then fill the tube with sand. Close the other end with duct tape. You can either leave them flat or bend them into circles until the two ends are touching and secure the ends together with duct tape.\nThis is a great method for making weights of different sizes. Start with 1 or 3 pounds. You can also try 5 or even 8 pound weights. Use a scale to weight out the weights before you close them.', '9. Make a weighted vest. Get a fishing vest or a vest with multiple small pockets. Fill plastic bags with sand or concrete and place in all the pockets. Run, do pull ups, push ups, or go walking while wearing the weighted vest.', '10. Use paint cans. Hold paint cans in your hands by their handles. Most paint cans are a little heavier than plastic bottles or cans of food, so you can use them as you build muscle. The handles allow you to use the cans like dumbbells.', '1. Use 5 gallon (18.9 L) buckets. Fill a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket with sand, rocks, concrete, or even water.  Use it to do curls or attach two of them to a bar or board and use as a bench press.', ""2. Make a barbell with water bottles. Take 2 packs of 6 bottles each and duct tape them symmetrically to an iron bar you can grip easily. This barbell will be good for any exercise you do with a barbell, like lifts and presses.\nIf these 2 packs are too much, don't use half filled bottles. Half-filled bottles will slosh around and shake the bar. Instead, tape individual filled bottles to the bar.\nIf 2 packs aren't enough, use four or six packs of bottles taped to the bar. Alternately, tape individual bottles to each end of the bar. First line them horizontally along the bar side by side, then stack them on top of each other. Make sure to leave plenty of room for your hands to grip the bar in wide and narrow grips.\nThe taping must be functional. Make horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rounds to wrap the packs to the bar."", '3. Find old tires lying around the yard. Tires are used in many workout and bodybuilding routines. You can add additional weights to regular tires when doing workouts, or you can go to a junkyard and find tractor tires. Flipping them and tying a rope to them to pull behind you are only two ways you can use a tire as a weight.', '4. Build a slosh tube. Slosh tubes are long plastic tubes filled with about 40 pounds of water. But the workout benefits come from the uneven, sloshing water, which makes you use muscles as you try to keep the water balanced as it goes from one end of the tube to the other. You can make your own slosh tube with a PVC pipe. The pipe should be about 4 inches in diameter and 9-10 feet long. Place a cap on one end, then fill the pipe halfway with water. Cap the other end.', ""5. Use a duffle bag to make a sandbag. Sandbags are similar to slosh tubes in that they are unstable, shifting weights that require you to engage more muscles. To make an easy sandbag, fill 5 or 6 gallon freezer bags with sand. You want the sandbag to be around 50 or 60 pounds. Double bag the bags so they don't break, and then tape the end. Place the bags into the duffle bag. Zip up the duffle bag, and you are ready to work out!\nAn alternate way to make a sandbag is to use an old army/navy rucksack or canvas laundry bag. Use contractor garbage bags to fill with pea gravel. You can fill them with 10, 20, or 25 pounds. Fill 5 or 6 bags with gravel, and secure them with duct tape. Add them to the bag until your desired weight.\nAdd and remove bags of sand or gravel for different weights. Use a scale to determine how heavy the bag is before you start working out, and add or remove weight accordingly. If you don't want to change the weight, you can add the sand or gravel directly into the bag. You cannot easily remove the weight or add weight if you do this.\nMake sure to leave some room in the interior bags so the sand or gravel can move around.\nIf you are adding a large amount of weight, use a sturdier duffle bag."", '1. Use a milk or juice jug. Fill a clean, plastic gallon jug or 2 liter (0.5 US gal) bottle with water or sand. Make sure that the jug has a handle; this is needed to complete kettlebell exercises.', '2. Use old paint cans as kettlebells. Since old paint cans are meant to withstand being swung around, they can make great improvised kettlebells. Simply repurpose your paint can dumbbells to use in kettlebell exercises.', ""3. Make a kettlebell out of a potato sack. Purchase a potato, rice, or sugar shipping sack, which can be found at most grocery stores. Fill the sack with sand until you have reached the desired weight. At the top of the sack, tie a loop for your hand. Use rope or duct tape to secure the loop so it doesn't detach. You can reinforce the sides and bottom of the bag with duct tape.\nYou can use this method to make multiple kettlebells of different weights. Use a scale to measure out how many pounds you are putting into the sacks before tying the top of the sack.""]"

Stir 15 grams (1/2 ounce) of malt extract into the water until it is completely dissolved. Bring it to a boil for another 10-15 minutes. This will ensure sterility.\nThis second boil is sanitizing the medium mixture, which is called “wort.”', '3. Add a packet of gelatin to the wort. Stir it until it is dissolved -- completely dissolved.', ""4. Pour some of the gelatin-wort mixture into each of the jars or dishes you’re using to make your cultures. Fill each container about 1/4 inch full. It's easiest to do this with a sterilized funnel if you're using a test tube or vials.\nKeep one empty jar or dish aside for use later in the culturing process."", ""5. Place the jars or dishes in the bottom of the large stock pot. Make sure it has a lid! This is where having vessels with a flat bottom comes in handy. If you're using tubes with a rounded base, you'll need to rack them to stand them up."", ""6. Add 2 to 3 inches (5 - 7.5 cm) of water to the dish. Or enough so that the water comes halfway up the sides of your culturing vessels. Make sure the water does not get inside the jars.\nAdd the jar lids carefully. Don't put them on, just in -- this will sterilize them. If you put them on, everything may explode."", '7. Bring the water in the stock pot to a boil. Keep it on high for 15 minutes to sterilize the culturing vessels. Then remove vessels from the hot water using your kitchen tongs and cool completely. This may take a while, so be patient.\nYou need to wait for things to cool to at least 40 deg. C before attaching the sterile caps, otherwise the cooling growth-medium will cause the vials to either suck the caps into the vials, or actually implode. Once cool enough, put the caps on the vials firmly. Pros generally cool for 24 hours at a slant.\nThese are often referred to as “slants” by home brewers because many use test tubes and invert them at an angle so the wort-gelatin mixture inside solidifies on a slant.', ""8. Lay out your working area. You're now going to need a number of things. It'll be easiest if you have them all at your side when you begin this process. You'll need:\nYeast pack\nSlant vials\nAn unwrapped paper clip or long needle\nCotton ball or folded up paper-towel\nYour vial of ethyl alcohol\nYour starter vessel laid out on clean paper toweling,\nAn empty, unused slant vial that has been sterilized, along with its cap."", ""9. Prepare the yeast as directed on the package. Each package will list different tips and instructions, so follow them carefully. You'll need to shake the yeast so it swells and forms a paste."", '10. Start culturing your slants. Open the yeast packet about halfway. Wipe the needle or paper clip with the alcohol swab (this sterilizes the needle and removes contaminants that could prevent the yeast from culturing properly).\nDraw a small amount of the yeast paste into the needle or swirl the paper clip around in the yeast packet to coat it.', '11. Insert the needle into the gelatin mixture and release the yeast. Work as quickly as possible during this step to prevent contamination. Avoid breathing if at all possible.\nSome brewers recommend placing an alcohol-soaked paper towel over the opening of the jar or dish and inserting the needle or paper clip through it into the dish to help prevent contamination when inserting the yeast.', '12. Cap the jar or dish tightly. Place the jars in a clean, cool, dark place for 72 hours. Within a couple of days you will see a cloudy film on the slant surface, and a few days later it will develop into a milky white layer about 1 mm thick.\nWipe the outside of the jars and lids with alcohol swabs. As always, everything needs to be completely sterile.', ""13. Loosen each jar slightly to release the pressure built up in each jar, then tighten again.\nYou'll notice a slight hissing sound as you break the seal on the jar. That's excess carbon dioxide from the yeast grows as it escapes to reduce the pressure in the jar."", '14. Label each jar with the date it was cultured. Store in a clean refrigerator to continue culture growth. They will keep in perfect condition for at least 3 months.', '1. Boil 1 medium potato in unsalted water until done. Drain, but save the water.', '2. Mash the potato. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar and and a pinch of salt.', '3. Cool to lukewarm. Add enough potato water to make one quart of mixture.', '4. Cover and set in a warm place. Allow to ferment.\nNote: If the starter is not rising, you can add a package of store bought yeast to speed up the process––but––it will be just as good if allowed to ferment without the added yeast.']"
Hobbies and Crafts,"[""1. Find 2 to 8 players.  Monopoly can be played with as few as 2 people up to 8 players at most. Each number of players brings its own advantages and drawbacks so it is important to know them before you decide on how many people are going to play.\n2-person games are not recommended due to the nature and mechanics of the game. At the start of the game, both players will be evenly matched and find the game to last a long time. Once someone gets lucky or makes a great move, they usually win the game without a chance for their opponent to catch up. Do not let this deter you though if you only have two available players. It can still be very fun.\n3-5 person games are great because of their balance between fairness and enjoyment. Games can last over two hours if players are evenly matched and when someone appears to be winning, there's a lot of room for the losing players to stay in the game.\n6-8 person games are fun but can have a few problems. As only one person can win the game, more players means there will be more losers. Furthermore, there is a longer wait between turns, yet this isn't too much of an issue as Monopoly gives you a handful of options you can do when it's not your turn, until everyone wants to do an action at once.\nMonopoly is intended to be played by people aged 8 or over. Younger players may not enjoy the game if they do not like to lose as the game requires some strategy to win. It is recommended to help new and young players by offering tips and opting for a more co-operative playstyle."", ""2. Choose a banker. This player is in charge of all the money, property, houses, and hotels still belonging to the bank. The banker can still play the game, but they should make sure their own money is separate from the bank's. If it is easier, the banker can place the box where most players can reach, allowing people to help themselves to money, houses and properties, providing that they only do this when they're allowed to."", '3. Set up the board. Unfold the Monopoly board and lay it on a flat surface. Make sure each player has enough space to keep their money and property deeds in front of them. You should also lay out the Chance and Community Chest cards on the board. They are marked in the center.', '4. Pick a game piece. Each player gets a game piece to move around the board. The game comes with a large selection, but you can also play with any small object. It does not matter what piece you choose as they all serve the same purpose.', '5. Give each player $1500. Before the game starts, the banker gives everybody their starting money. It should add up to $1500. Most players like to keep their lined up in front of them, but you can store your money any way you want as long as it is in front of you. Players may also exchange money for different bills of the same value. For example, giving $500 to the bank in exchange for 5 $100s.\nUS Version | UK Version\n2 $500s | 2 $500s\n2 $100s | 4 $100s\n2 $50s | 1 $50\n6 $20s | 1 $20\n5 $10s | 2 $10s\n5 $5s | 1 $5\n5 $1s | 5 $1s', '6. Roll the dice to pick the first player. Whoever rolls the highest number goes first, and play then continues clockwise around the board. You can use two dice or one, whichever you prefer. A quicker alternative is for the youngest or newest player to go first. This skips the initial dice rolling and gives them a small advantage. After the first turn, play goes to the player on the left in a clockwise fashion.', '1. Roll the dice and move your game piece. Each player rolls the dice and moves their game piece the same number of spaces. If you roll doubles, you get to move again after resolving the space you have landed on.', '2. Look at the space you landed on. Monopoly has many different kinds of spaces. Most of them are properties that you can buy or pay rent on, but some of them require you to draw a card from one of two decks, collect money, or even go to jail.', ""3. Buy an unowned property when you land on it. If you are the first one to land on a spot with a colored stripe across the top, a railroad, or a utility, you may buy the property for the amount printed on the board. The banker in turn gives the player the title deed for that property. Most players recommend buying every property you can as if you don't, the other players have a chance to get it for cheaper."", '4. Auction any unsold property. If you land on an unowned property but choose not to buy it, then the property is auctioned and awarded to the highest bidder. This rule is part of the official game but many people omit it at home.\nWhenever a player who lands on an unowned property opts not to buy it, the banker takes over and auctions it off immediately. The player who initially declined to buy the property at the printed price can still participate in the auction. Bids start at $1 and stop when no one wants to increase their bid. If absolutely no one wants the property, it returns to the bank and the game resumes.', ""5. Collect rent. If you land on someone else's property, you must pay them the rent printed on the title deed card for that property (unless they have mortgaged the property). Rents vary according to the price of the property, whether or not a player has a complete color set (monopoly) and how many buildings have been built there."", '6. Buy all the properties in a colored group to get a monopoly. If you own all the properties in a colored group, you have a monopoly! This is one of the main goals of the game--you can bankrupt other players easily if you have a monopoly. Players with a monopoly get to charge double rent for their property on unimproved sites of that color set. The reason rent is so high when you have a monopoly is based on real life business as no competitors means no need to fight for the lower price.', ""7. Build houses on your monopoly. If you have a monopoly, you can start to build houses on any of those properties to charge more rent. You can find the building prices on your property deed. You can build up to four houses on each property of your monopoly. \nBuildings raise the rent on your property significantly. For example, the first property on the board, Mediterranean Avenue, rents for $2 without any buildings. When you build four houses, you can charge $160 to each player who lands on it.\nYou have to build evenly--you can't build two houses on one property in your monopoly and none on the others. If you buy one building for a property, you can't put a second one on that property until you have bought a house for every property in your monopoly."", ""8. Build a hotel after you've built four houses. The most lucrative buildings you can add to your properties are hotels. After you've built four houses on each property, you can buy a hotel from the bank and replace the houses with them. A hotel is roughly equivalent to having five houses yet the maximum number of houses on a site is four. However, it is sometimes better to leave the four houses on each property instead of building the hotel if you wish to create a house shortage for other players."", '9. Collect $200 when you pass GO. Every time a player lands on or passes over the corner space marked ""GO,"" they earn a $200 salary. This is a great way to add a little cash to your reserves!\nAccording to the official rules, you only get $200 for passing or landing on the GO square, but many people allow you to collect more whenever you land right on GO. This house rule should be avoided as it can prolong the game in the bad sense of the word.', '10. Take a Chance or Community Chest card. If you land on a spot marked ""Chance"" or ""Community Chest,"" take the top card off of the corresponding deck of the space that you landed on. These cards have effects that can cause you to earn or lose money, move you across the track or even send you to jail. There\'s also the infamous ""get out of jail free"" card. When you\'re done reading the card, return it to the bottom of the corresponding deck.', '11. Go to jail. Going to jail prevents you from moving around the board until you\'re free.  But you still can collect rent, buy houses, participate in auctions, and trade with other players. There are three possible ways to go to jail:\nLanding on the space marked ""Go to Jail"" is the most common way to end in jail.  The player goes diagonally across the board to the jail space without passing GO, and their turn ends immediately.\nIf you pick a Chance or Community Chest card that reads this, your turn ends immediately and you must go directly to the space marked ""In jail"". If you pass GO on the way to jail, you don\'t get to collect your $200. Put your game piece inside the jail cell when you are sent to jail.\nRolling three consecutive doubles on the same turn also sends you to jail immediately. Place your token into the jail cell as soon as the third double is rolled.\nIf you just land on the jail space by an ordinary dice roll, you can place your token on the ""Just Visiting"" section of the square. You are not subject to any restrictions and can take your next turn as usual.\nYou can get out of jail by paying $50 bail, using a Get Out of Jail Free card, or rolling doubles on your next turn.  If you succeed in rolling a double to get out of jail, you move forward the given number of spaces but do not take another turn.  You must leave jail on your third turn and immediately pay $50 if you fail to roll doubles on that turn.', ""12. Make deals with other players. Trading with other players is a key part of the strategy of any Monopoly game.  This is usually how you obtain a monopoly to build houses and hotels.   Many players also have house rules that allow them to grant rent immunity to another player, lend money to another player, or borrow from the bank without mortgaging property.\nDo not include any house rules during your first game as including them can impact the enjoyment of the game and extend how long the game goes on for which isn't a good thing."", ""1. Set a time limit to determine the winner (optional). If you want a faster game, try setting a timer for 1 or 2 hours. When the timer goes off, each player counts their total amount of money, the printed prices of all their unmortgaged properties, half the prices of all their mortgaged properties, and the printed prices of all houses and hotels.  The richest player wins the game!\nIf you do decide to play using a time limit, players' strategies can differ slightly. In a normal game of monopoly, the winner of the game could have a bad start and be very poor early on. You may want to declare the winner not to be the richest player but the one who made the best decisions, decided by your group democratically."", ""2. Do NOT award money for landing on Free Parking. Many people use a variation of the rules to add more money to the game. Instead of putting tax money or other payments back in the bank, they put it in the center of the board and give it to anyone who lands on Free Parking. While it's fun to win a pile of money, it actually makes the game go on for much longer! A game of Monopoly should only take about two hours."", ""3. Mortgage property. If you can't pay the rent when you land on a property, you can mortgage your property. You can also choose to mortgage a property to buy other properties, houses, or hotels.  When a property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. To unmortgage it, you must pay 10% interest when you pay it off. If you have to pay a decimal, always round it up.\nMortgages have their rewards and their consequences. You should only mortgage a property to avoid bankruptcy or to make a quick boost of money for buying more properties and trading. You can also sell your mortgaged properties to other players, causing them to pay the bank if they want to collect rent on that property. The 10% interest is far better than the 50% loss from selling buildings."", ""4. Go bankrupt. If you owe more money than you and your assets can afford, you're declared bankrupt and are out of the game. In official rules, your money and properties are given to the player who caused you to become bankrupt after selling all the buildings first. However, this can cause a winning player to win even more. It is recommended that when a player becomes bankrupt, all of their property is auctioned off as this makes the game a bit more balanced for the remaining players.""]"

Sports and Fitness,"['1. Eat healthy fats. Many dieters believe that they need to avoid fat like the plague when trying to lose weight. However, eating a certain amount of healthy fat is essential for a balanced diet and can actually aid weight loss. In fact, studies suggest that a diet with a higher ratio of monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) (avocados, nuts, seeds, soybeans, chocolate) can prevent the accumulation of belly fat. As a result, 25 to 30% of your daily calorie intake should come from such healthy fats.\nPolyunsaturated fats - such as the Omega-3 fatty acids found in mackerel, salmon, herring, walnuts, canola oil and tofu - are another type of healthy fat that you should try to incorporate into your diet. They help to lower bad cholesterol and boost brain function.\nTrans fats, on the other hand, (found in margarine, crackers, cookies--anything made with partially hydrogenated oils) result in more fat being deposited in the abdomen, so you should avoid these as much as you can.', ""2. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. It is very common for dieters to try to starve themselves between meals, with the result that they actually eat much more than necessary when the food is finally in front of them. One of the best kept secrets of successful dieters is that they actually eat more frequently throughout the day, they just eat smaller meals.Note: Eating smaller, more frequent meals prevents dieters from becoming too hungry, causing them to eat less overall. It also stimulates the metabolism, which allows the body to burn more calories throughout the day.\n\nTry eating six small meals a day, rather than your regular three large ones. You'll find sticking to your weight-loss plan much easier in the long-run if you're not in a constant state of hunger!"", ""3. Start the day with a healthy breakfast. Kicking off the day with a healthy, balanced breakfast is one of the best things you can do when following a weight-loss diet. A good breakfast kick starts the metabolism, allowing you to burn more calories throughout the day. It also keeps you fuller for longer, reducing your tendency to snack throughout the morning and afternoon, which may result in a higher calorie intake overall.\nTry eating a combination of filling wholegrain cereals and breads, protein-rich eggs and high-vitamin fruits for the perfect balanced breakfast. If you're on the go, grab a fruit smoothie and a cereal bar for convenient, yet filling goodness.\nYou should also try to drink a glass of water before breakfast (and every other meal throughout the day) as this prevents your body from confusing thirst with hunger, which may lead to you eating more than you need. Plus it helps to keep you hydrated, which is always important."", ""4. Get more fiber in your diet. Fiber-rich foods are an essential component of any healthy diet, for a number of reasons. Firstly, fiber-rich foods help to normalize bowel movements, which minimizes bloating and blockages. Secondly, fiber-rich foods help you to stay fuller longer and may require additional chewing time, thus preventing overeating. High-fiber foods also tend to be lower in calories than other food types.\nTry to incorporate a wide range of high-fiber foods into your diet, to get the benefits of both soluble and insoluble fibers. Examples of soluble fibers include oats and barley, peas and beans, apples, carrots and citrus fruits. Examples of insoluble fibers include wheat bran and products containing whole-wheat flour, nuts, beans and green vegetables.\nSoluble fiber, in particular, has also been shown to lower insulin levels, which can speed up the burning of visceral belly fat.\nPlain water is the best alternative, as it flushes out your system, reduces bloating and keeps the body hydrated. However, if you find plain old water too boring, try drinking water with a hint of flavoring like mint leaves, lemon, lime, or even toss in a few frozen raspberries or create a combination- Be creative! Vitamin water, or naturally sweetened iced teas also make a significantly healthier alternative to sodas.\nDon't use straws. You should also avoid using straws to sip your drinks, as straws cause you to suck more air into your stomach as you drink, leading to bloating and a bigger belly. Drink straight from the cup instead to avoid bloating."", '5. Avoid processed foods. Even if you are carefully monitoring your portion sizes and consistently working out, your weight loss can be significantly impaired by a continued consumption of processed foods. This is because processed foods typically have high sugar and starch contents, which limit weight loss and lead to the buildup of harmful toxins.\nBe extra careful when it comes to products that are marked ""non-fat"", such as cheeses, breads, yogurts, etc. These products may have a low fat content, but they are usually packed with extra sugar and empty carbohydrates, and offer very little, if any, nutritional value. Some frozen processed organic meals are actually not too bad, as long as you make sure to carefully read all the labels and check the content and ingredients list.\nYou should also avoid processed food products with a high salt content, such as ready-meals and frozen goods, as the salt leads to water retention and causes bloating. Just go for fresh foods instead of pre-packaged or frozen whenever possible.', ""6. Be prepared to change your diet. Getting a smaller waist will require weight loss, which cannot be achieved through exercise alone. You will also need to adhere to a healthy diet and reduce your calorie intake in order to really see results. You should find a trainer to help you calculate a proper amount of calorie intake a day. This will require discipline and determination. In addition to reducing your calorie intake, there are also some smart food choices you can make that will specifically help to reduce your waistline.\nFor example, in a scientific study, people who ate all whole grains (in addition to five servings of fruits and vegetables, three servings of low-fat dairy, and two servings of lean meat, fish, or poultry) lost more belly fat than another group that ate the same diet, but with all refined grains. Remember that fruits have sugar, so exceeding your intake of fruits per day will impede your progress.\nKeep in mind that in order to lose a pound of weight, you will need to cut 3500 calories from your diet. Health specialists advise that the optimal level of healthy weight loss is one to two pounds a week, so it is not recommended that you starve yourself or follow fad diets in order to lose weight more quickly.\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaila Ajani\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFitness Trainer\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaila Ajani is a Fitness Trainer and founder of Push Personal Fitness, a personal training organization based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Most people have to pay attention to their diets to get a smaller waist."", ""1. Commit to an exercise routine. If you really want to trim your waist, you will need to commit to a regular and rigorous exercise routine. Great results will only come with hard work and dedication, so make sure you are prepared to put in the necessary effort before you begin. On the other hand, if you begin exercising too rigorously from the get-go, you may become disheartened and disillusioned, and therefore much more inclined to give up.\nTip: To overcome this, try making an exercise plan where you start at a reasonable level, before gradually building yourself up to longer more intense exercise routines. Keep a log of what you're doing each time in a record book or diary and check your progress against this.\nEventually you'll find yourself exercising regularly without feeling worn out or disinterested in it and your waist, along with your overall health and fitness, will have benefited a great deal."", ""2. Do plenty of cardio. As mentioned before, weight loss is essential when it comes to losing inches from your waist. Unfortunately, there is no way to target weight loss in a specific area of your body, so overall weight loss is the only option. Cardiovascular exercise is the best form of exercise for burning calories, so it is essential to any weight loss routine.\nRunning, skipping and cycling are all excellent cardio options, which usually don't even require a gym membership. Cheap, yet extremely effective, there's no excuse not to incorporate a little cardio into your workout.\nTrainers advocate tracking your heart rate during cardio. For example, the best way to shed fat is by walking on the trail or outside and keeping your heart rate at low-medium level. Have that after a session of endurance training and you are on the way to shed this fat.\nYou should do at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous cardio each week. You can even do a blend of moderate and vigorous activity. To reach this goal, aim for 30 minutes of cardio exercise four to five times a week."", ""3. Make sure you work out the correct core muscles. Many core strength-building exercises focus on the oblique muscles, which run along the side of your stomach. Although working these muscles will give you a toned and flat stomach, it will also build up the muscle, making your waist appear wider than before. This is definitely not what you want when aiming for a tiny waist. To work your core and trim your waist you should focus on your transverse and rectus abdominals.\nNote: Your transverse abdominals work as your body's natural corset and so with enough work in this area you can achieve a smaller waist. Pilates does a lot of work that focuses on the transverse abdominals and therefore can be a very effective method.\nRemember to breathe when exercising core muscles. While it may seem obvious, many people forget in the concentration on getting the muscle action correct and then you leave your body tense and fragile. Instead, remember to breathe in and out, on the way up, on the way down, etc. If you can't work this out in a rhythm that works for you, consider joining yoga or Pilates for help."", '4. Do specific waist-shaping exercises. Even though you can\'t target weight loss on your waist, you can certainly perform certain exercises which tone and slim the muscles around the midsection.\nDo the \'hundred\' exercise. This is done by lying on your back and lifting your legs up to a 90 degree angle. Raise your shoulder blades off the floor with your arms reaching towards your feet. Begin by pumping your arms up and down, and repeat for 100 pumps. Breathe in through the nose for five pumps and out through the mouth for five pumps. As you get stronger, you can start to lower the legs closer to the ground until your legs are only a few inches above the floor. Remember to keep your upper torso lifted off the ground.\nSuck in your stomach. Try to keep your stomach sucked in throughout the day, while sitting at your desk, in the car or at the grocery store. This works the stomach muscles, while simultaneously making you look slimmer. Over time, you won\'t even notice you\'re doing it!\n\nDo sit ups. Lie down on the floor or a yoga mat, and bend your knees while keeping your feet flat on the ground. Cross your arms over your chest. Slowly raise your upper body towards your knees before lowering yourself back down again.  Work up to doing three sets of sit ups, with 10-20 repetitions in each set.\nDo twist crunches. This requires you to lie on your back and bend your knees up while keeping your feet flat on the floor. Bring your fingers up to touch your ears and slowly contract your abdominal muscles, lifting your torso off the ground. When you\'re at the point of feeling you can\'t lift your body any further, contract your side muscles and turn gently to the left. Return your torso flat to the floor. Repeat on the right side. Build up to two or three sets of ten to fifteen repetitions each.\n\nDo a plank. Get into the position for doing a push up. Rest on your forearms and keep your eyes to the floor at all times. Pull your stomach muscles in tight, imagining them touching your backbone. As you do this, your bottom should be down and your back straight. Aim to hold this position for about a minute.\nDo the side plank. This exercise targets the ""muffin top"" region of the body. Lie down on a comfortable mat, on your right side. Rest on your right arm and extend your legs outward, placing your left foot on top of your right foot. In this position, slowly lift your pelvis up from the floor. Contract the muscles all around the lower torso, including the lower back and hips. Continue to bear weight on your right forearm and feet. Aim to hold this lift for around 10-15 seconds. Repeat three to five times for each side, or work up to holding the pose for 60 seconds.', '5. Build your chest and shoulders. Emphasizing upper curves can make the waist seem to shrink, so you should incorporate some shoulder and chest building exercises into your workout routine in order to give the illusion of a smaller waist. Some specific exercises include:\nBench dips. This exercise works the arms and shoulders and is performed using an exercise step or kitchen chair. To do a bench dip, sit up straight on the edge of the bench or chair, extending your legs in front of you. Firmly grip the edge of the bench or chair and slowly slide your body off the bench, lowering yourself towards the floor. Keep your back straight, and keep lowering until your arms form a 90 degree angle. Push your body back to the original starting position and repeat.\n\nPush-ups. This classic exercise works the chest muscles. It can be done by propping your body up on your toes (for a more advanced version) or by balancing on your knees (for an easier version). To do it, place your hands palms-down on the floor, approximately shoulder width apart and raise yourself up, using just the strength in your arms, until both arms are fully extended. Slowly lower your body down again until your elbows form a 90-degree angle. Raise yourself back up into the extended arm position and repeat.', ""6. Try something different. Exercise regimes can become repetitive and boring, making you less inclined to follow through with them. This is why it's important to shake things up from time to time and try something new, whether it's a new form of exercise, or simply incorporating a new prop. Here are some suggestions for shaking up your exercise regime that can also help to improve your waist reduction:\nUse a hula-hoop. Your waist and hips will benefit from 10 minutes a day of hula-hooping, with the added bonus you get to behave like a kid again each day!\nOne way to get and keep your waist (and the rest of your body) looking great is to dance! You don't have to start up dance lessons, but turn on the radio or listen to your iPod and party around for about 20-30 minutes every day. Make sure you're moving all of your body. Dancing burns off lots of calories and it feels great when you're having fun, and you'll look and feel great!\nUse dumbbells. Build shoulder muscles by lifting dumbbells out from your sides for resistance. Lift 10 times for each set, four sets a day. The broader your shoulders and outer thighs, the narrower your waist appears.\nConsider doing yoga or Pilates; these are great activities for core abdominal muscle exercises and you can also be part of a group session which can be very motivating.\nMake exercising comfortable; ensure that you have floor mats, breathable clothing, a water bottle, and other things that help increase your enjoyment of exercise. Music in the background can also add motivation."", '1. Wear waist-cinching belts. Draw attention to your waist by wearing belts that emphasize and nip in your middle. They can be wide, skinny, jeweled, braided -- whatever! Wear them over dresses, long tops and even winter coats to get an hourglass figure which gives the illusion of a smaller waist.', '2. Wear A-line dresses. A-line dresses are those which are tight at the hips, then flare out towards the hem, giving the illusion of a smaller waist. They are very flattering on almost every body shape, as they emphasize the waist, while skimming over any imperfections around the hips and thighs.', '3. Avoid low-rise jeans. Low-rise jeans can be very unflattering to anyone who carries even a little weight around their middle, as they create the dreaded ""muffin top"" effect. High waisted jeans are much more forgiving as they cover up any excess fat around the hips, and draw attention to the waist. Worn with a tucked-in shirt, these type of jeans can be very flattering indeed.', '4. Try wearing a body-shaping undergarments. Picking the right foundation garments can greatly reduce your waistline.\nTry ""shapewear"". Most quality lingerie stores carry lines of undergarments that are designed to smooth and support your figure.\nCorsets. Worn under gowns as a figure enhancing item of lingerie in centuries gone by, the corset has gained renewed popularity recently for providing an effortlessly sexy silhouette, whether under other clothes or on its own. Steel-boned corsets (not as painful as they sound - promise!) do the best job of cinching in your waist, and can actually permanently reduce the size of your waist with prolonged wear!']"
Health,"['1. Understand what a medical mask protects you from.  Medical or surgical masks are intended to cover both your mouth and nose.  They are designed with material that can block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays and splatter — all of which may contain viruses or bacteria that may be harmful to you.\nNote: Small-sized particles, however, may still be able to penetrate a medical mask.  And, because the medical mask isn’t sealed against your skin, particles are also able to penetrate those openings.', '2. Know the difference between a medical mask and an N95 respirator.  An N95 respirator is a device used by health practitioners to block 95% of very small particles.  Unlike medical masks, N95 respirators fit more securely on your face and against your skin, and are able to filter airborne particles.\nWhile an N95 respirator can block 95% of very small particles — very small being considered 0.3 microns — there is still a 5% chance harmful particles can penetrate the respirator.\nN95 respirators are not designed for use by children or by people who have facial hair.\nSome N95 masks come with an exhalation valve that is designed to reduce condensation build-up inside the mask and allow the wearer to breathe easier.  These masks, however, should not be used in a situation where a sterile field is required as the exhalation valve allows unfiltered (and possibly contaminated) air to leave the mask.\nIn general, each type of N95 mask should come with detailed instructions from the manufacturer explaining how to put on and take off the mask.  In order to ensure proper protection for both you and your patients, these instructions — above all others — must be followed.  The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) also requires that users are trained how to fit and use N95 respirators.', '1. Clean your hands.  Before touching a clean medical mask, wash your hands thoroughly with both soap and water.\nTip: Before you throw away your paper towel,  use it to open/close a door after you’ve washed your hands.\nOnce you’ve applied soap to your wet hands, you should rub your hands together to wash them for at least 20 seconds before rinsing them off.\nAlways use a clean paper towel to dry your hands, and then place that paper towel into a trash bin.', '2. Check the medical mask for defects. Once you’ve taken a new (unused) medical mask from the box, check it to ensure it doesn’t contain any defects, holes or tears in the material.  If the mask has defects, holes or tears, throw it away and select another new (unused) mask from the box.', '3. Orient the top of the mask properly.  In order for the mask to fit as close to your skin as possible, the top portion of the mask will have a bendable, but stiff, edge that can be moulded around your nose.  Ensure this bendable side is facing upwards before applying the mask to your face.', '4. Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards.  The inside of most medical masks are white in colour, while the outside has a colour of some sort.  Before applying the mask to your face, make sure the white side of the mask is facing towards your face.', '5. Place the mask on your face.  There are many types of medical masks available, each with different methods of attaching the mask to your head.\n\nEar Loops — Some masks have 2 ear loops on either side of the mask.  These loops are normally made of an elastic material so they can be stretched.  Pick up this type of mask by the loops, put 1 loop around one ear and then put the other loop around your other ear.\n\nTies or Straps — Some masks comes with pieces of fabric that are tied around the back of your head.  Most masks with ties come with upper and lower ties or straps.  Pick up the mask by the upper ties, place the ties around the back of your head and attach them together with a bow.\n\nBands — Some masks come with 2 elastic bands that are placed over and around the back of your head (as opposed to around your ears).  Hold the mask in front of your face, pull the top band over the top of your head and place it around the crown of your head.  Then pull the bottom band over the top of your head and place it at the base of your skull.', '6. Adjust the nose piece.  Now that the medical mask is in place on your head and face, use your index finger and thumb to pinch the bendable portion of the top edge of the mask around the bridge of your nose.', '7. Tie the lower band of the mask if needed.  If you’re using a mask with bands that tie on the top and bottom, you can now tie the bottom band around the base of your skull.  Because adjusting the bendable nose piece can impact the fit of the mask, it is best to wait until after the nose piece is in place before tying the bottom straps.\nIf you’ve already tied the bottom straps, you may need to re-tie them more tightly to get a snug fit.', '8. Fit the mask to your face and under your chin.  Once the mask is completely secured, adjust it to ensure it covers your face and mouth, and so the bottom edge is under your chin.\n\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWorld Health Organization\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGlobal Public Health Agency\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe World Health Organization (WHO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for international public health.

Clean your hands.  Depending on what you were doing with your hands before you remove your mask, you may need to wash your hands.  Or you may need to remove medical gloves, wash your hands, then remove the mask.', '2. Remove the mask carefully.  In general, remove the mask by only touching the edges, straps, loops, ties or bands.  Do not touch the front portion of the mask which may be contaminated.\n\nEar Loops — Use your hands to hold the ear loops and remove them from around each ear.\n\nTies/Straps — Use your hands to untie the bottom straps first, then untie the top straps.  Remove the mask while holding onto the top ties.\n\nBands — Use your hands to bring the bottom elastic band up and over your head, then use your hands to do the same with the top elastic band.  Remove the mask from your face while holding the top elastic band.', '3. Dispose of your mask safely.  Medical masks are designed to only be used once.  Therefore when you take the mask off, place it in the trash immediately.\nIn medical settings there is most likely a garbage bin specifically for biohazardous items like used masks and gloves.\nIn a non-medical setting where the mask could be contaminated, place the mask by itself inside a plastic bag.  Tie the plastic bag closed and then throw the plastic bag in the garbage bin.', '4. Wash your hands again.  Once you’ve disposed of the mask safely, wash your hands once more to ensure they’re clean and didn’t get contaminated by touching the dirty mask.']"
Personal Care and Style,"[""1. Try a low fade on hair with more texture. If your client’s hair is thick or wavy, buzz the hair with the shortest clipper guard settings at a lower area, preferably below the ears and around the nape of the neck. Low fades show off a hair's texture better and work with the hair's natural pattern.\nThe longer the hair is on top, the lower the fade should be."", '2. Choose a high fade for more contrast. If you want a cleaner, more buzzed style on the back and sides, go with the lowest clipper guard settings moving up to the temples. Try a high fade for a sleeker look.\nHigh fades work well with square or round face shapes because they lengthen the appearance of the face.', '3. Use a pair of clippers and styling scissors to cut a fade. Choose a pair of clippers with at least 3 guard lengths so you can blend the client’s hair as you go. Use clippers on the back, sides, and nape and styling scissors on the top.\nIf you prefer a softer fade, you can also use styling scissors on the back and sides. However, keep in mind that this is an advanced technique, so do not attempt it unless you are very experienced with fades.\nDo not use household scissors to trim hair, as it can result in a blunt or uneven cut.\nKeep in mind that you can use clippers near the top of your head too if you like it shorter than {[convert|1|in|cm|abbr=on}}.', ""4. Wash and dry the hair before cutting it. Damp, clean hair is easier to work with while cutting fades. Wash the person's hair with shampoo, rinse it with water, and air or towel dry it until it is damp.\nThe hair should be somewhat damp, not dripping wet, to make cutting it simpler. The client’s hair should not be so wet that it clumps together or you may end up cutting out chunks of it."", ""1. Trim the top with styling scissors. Lift sections of hair from the top of the head so that the tips of the hair protrude from between your forefinger and middle finger. Trim the tips of the hair with the scissors at your desired length.\nContinue trimming the hair at the top of the head in sections until you've trimmed it to the same length.\nIf the person has bangs, trim the bangs in sections for a neat and even line."", '2. Trim the entire sides and back with a long guard size. Set the clippers to a long guard length, depending on how long you want the top of the fade, and buzz the entire back and sides. Continue trimming until each part of the hair is a uniform length.\nUse a vertical movement to cut the hair starting at the hairline and up towards the top of the client’s head.\nWork against the grain of the hair to achieve an even cut.\nLift the clippers up and outwards slightly at the end of each stroke as you get close to the rounded part of the person’s head to help the cuts fade together smoothly.', '3. Cut the back of the head with the next shortest guard. Switch to the next shortest guard and, beginning in the back, cut the hair in vertical strokes from the neck toward the crown. Stop just below the crown so that the hair on top of the head is left long.\nIf you were using a #3 guard size, for example, switch to a #2.\nBlend any uneven lines that you notice by going back over them with the clippers.', ""4. Buzz the nape with the shortest guard setting. Start at the nape of the neck and cut in upward strokes toward the back of the head's center. Work your around the head's back and sides, pulling back at the same height for an even finish.\nPull back with your clippers to blend the nape's short hair with the back's long hair.\nShave the hair from the nape and below to create a clean, neat edge."", '1. Clean the edges with your clippers. Move your clippers on the shortest guard setting along the nape and edges of the sides. If you find any poorly blended or uneven spots while you go, go back over them with the appropriate clipper guard. You should also turn the blade around and use it to go around the edges of the hairline. This will help to create a clean outline.', '2. Inspect the fade and brush off any hair clippings. Ask the client to look at their new cut and determine whether they would like a shorter or longer fade. Brush away any cut hair from the neck and collar before you move on to styling the hair\nIf the person wants a shorter cut, trim off small amounts at a time to avoid cutting off too much.', '3. Style the top with a hair styling product. Clay, wax, gel, and pomade all work well with faded hair. Work a small amount of styling product into the top, brushing or combing it as you do so to give it a clean, neat look.\nAsk the client what products they normally use and, if possible, incorporate these items, so they can replicate the style themselves.', '4. Trim the fade every 4 to 6 weeks, as regular maintenance. To maintain the same hair length and fade, re-trim the cut approximately once every 4 to 6 weeks. Although fades grow out evenly, their style can change significantly as they grow out and require routine trims.\nUse the same clipper guards and styling method that you did while initially cutting the hair.']"
Philosophy and Religion,"[""1. Start in the morning. Rather than practising astral projection at night, right before you go to sleep, start in the early morning hours when you're still feeling drowsy. Some say that it's easier to reach the necessary state of relaxation and heightened awareness around dawn. Yet it is possible to astral travel at any time so there are no hard and fast rules. It is a personal preference or simply astral traveling when we feel empowered to do it."", ""2. Create the right atmosphere. Astral projection requires a state of deep relaxation, so it should be performed in a part of your home where you're completely comfortable. Lie on your bed or sofa and relax your mind and body.\nIt's easier to perform astral projection alone than it is with someone else in the room. If you usually sleep with a partner, choose a room other than the bedroom to practice astral projection. A good time to do it is when no one else is in and make sure no one is going to walk into the room when you're in astral flight.\nDraw the shades or curtains and rid the room of distracting noises. Any type of interruption could disrupt the state of relaxation you need to achieve."", ""3. Lie down and relax. Position yourself on your back in your chosen room. Close your eyes and try to clear your mind of distracting thoughts. Concentrate on your body and how it feels. The goal is to achieve a state of complete mind and body relaxation.\nFlex your muscles and then loosen them. Start with your toes and work your way up your body, gradually making your way to your head. Make sure every muscle is completely relaxed when you are through.\nBreathe deeply and exhale completely. Don't hold tension in your chest and shoulders, just relax.\nFocus your mind on your breathing. Don't get carried away with thoughts of outside worries, and don't get preoccupied yet with the idea of your soul projecting from your body. Just let yourself sink into relaxation.\nIt can be helpful to use a quartz crystal to raise and speed up your vibrations as preparation. Gently hold the crystal on your third eye slightly above the centre of your eyebrows with closed eyes and breathing deeply. Feel the vibrations and your head clearing; you can envision golden, white, purple or any colour light if you like. During the meditation and astral travelling you can hold the crystal in your hand or place it on your chest or abdomen. The crystal will empower and protect you because of its high vibrations; negative energies have lower vibrations."", '1. Reach a hypnotic state. This hypnotic state is normally known as the hypnagogic state. Let your body and mind approach sleep, but don\'t completely lose consciousness. Being at the edge of wakefulness and sleep, a hypnotic state, is necessary for astral projection to occur. Reach this state using the following method:\nKeeping your eyes closed, let your mind wander to a part of your body, such as your hand, foot or a single toe.{""smallUrl"":""https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/db\\/Perform-Astral-Projection-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-460px-Perform-Astral-Projection-Step-4Bullet1.jpg"",""bigUrl"":""\\/images\\/thumb\\/d\\/db\\/Perform-Astral-Projection-Step-4Bullet1.jpg\\/aid1092428-v4-728px-Perform-Astral-Projection-Step-4Bullet1.jpg"",""smallWidth"":460,""smallHeight"":345,""bigWidth"":""728"",""bigHeight"":""546"",""licensing"":""<div class=\\""mw-parser-output\\""><p>License: <a rel=\\""nofollow\\"" class=\\""external text\\"" href=\\""https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\"">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>""}\n\nFocus on the body part until you can visualize it perfectly, even with your eyes closed.

Move your legs, your arms, and your head using only your mind. Keep your focus steady until you\'re able to move your whole body in your mind alone.', ""2. Enter into a state of vibration. Many report feeling vibrations, which come in waves at different frequencies, as the soul prepares to leave the body. Don't be afraid of the vibrations, since the presence of fear might cause you to leave your meditative state; instead, succumb to the vibrations as your soul prepares to leave your body."", ""3. Use your mind to move your soul from your body. Imagine in your mind the room in which you are lying. Move your body in your mind to stand up. Look around yourself. Get up off the bed and walk across the room, then turn around and look at your body on the bed.\nYour OBE is successful if you feel as though you are gazing upon your body from across the room, and that your conscious self is now separate from your body.\nIt takes a lot of practice to get to this point for some people, though for others it comes as naturally as breathing. Either way it is possible for everyone if it is desired and practised enough! If you have trouble completely lifting your soul from your body, try lifting just a hand or a leg at first. Keep practising until you're able to move across the room."", '4. Return to your body. Your soul always remains connected to your body with an invisible force, sometimes referred to as a ""silver cord."" Let the force guide your soul back to your body. Re-enter your body. Move your fingers and toes - physically, not just in your mind - and let yourself regain full consciousness.', '1. Confirm that you are projecting your soul from your body. Once you have mastered the act of projecting your soul from your body in the same room, you will want to confirm that you were indeed in two separate planes.\nNext time you practice the astral projection, don\'t turn around to look at your body. Instead, leave the room and walk into another room in the house.\nExamine an object in the other room, something that you had never noticed before in the physical sense. Make a mental note of its color, shape and size, paying attention to as many details as possible.{""smallUrl"":""https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/71\\/Perform-Astral-Projection-Step-8Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-460px-Perform-Astral-Projection-Step-8Bullet2.jpg"",""bigUrl"":""\\/images\\/thumb\\/7\\/71\\/Perform-Astral-Projection-Step-8Bullet2.jpg\\/aid1092428-v4-728px-Perform-Astral-Projection-Step-8Bullet2.jpg"",""smallWidth"":460,""smallHeight"":345,""bigWidth"":""728"",""bigHeight"":""546"",""licensing"":""<div class=\\""mw-parser-output\\""><p>License: <a rel=\\""nofollow\\"" class=\\""external text\\"" href=\\""https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\"">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>""}\n\nReturn to your body. Physically go into the room you previously projected yourself into. Walk to the article you examined during the astral travel. Can you confirm the details you noted when you explored the object with your mind?', '2. Explore further. During subsequent astral projection sessions, go to locations that are less and less familiar to you. Each time, note details that you had never noticed before. After each session, physically verify the details. After a few trips, you will be experienced enough to travel to locations that are completely unfamiliar with the confidence that you have actually performed astral projection.', ""3. Return to your body. Some say that astral projection is dangerous, especially when one gets enough practice to explore unfamiliar places but it need not be. Those people simply don't understand it or fear it because they don't use enough protection, as long as you ask for protection in your own way it'll be a good experience. Before you astral project it is nice to imagine yourself bathed in a glowing, white light. Imagine it as a cloud around you or inside you; this will protect you from other thought forms or negative energy forms.\nThere is so much to get into, but know that no harm will come to you unless you think it will. The thrill of having an OBE keeps some people out of their bodies for long periods of time, which is said to weaken the silver cord but the silver cord cannot be weakened. It is pure energy and energy can't be eliminated or removed, only moved from one place to another, or one form or another so don't worry about astral travelling; it is natural, powerful and healing.\nThe silver cord can never be broken, but it is said that your soul can be delayed from re-entering your body if you spend too much energy outside of it. Yet your soul and body are so intrinsically entwined that the soul will naturally come back when it's right to.\nSome say that demons can inhabit the body while the soul is being projected. If you fear this may happen, protect your body by blessing the room with a prayer before you perform projection. It is only hearsay anyway and seeing as you'll have already asked for light protection nothing bad will occur.\nYour soul can also interact with other astral projections. Try it with a friend who has practiced as much as you have. Some say astral sex is mind-blowing. However, remember to always return to your body.\nIt is possible to heal others during astral travel; this is a form of distance healing that is very powerful. Envision the sick person, perhaps lying in their bed. It doesn't matter if they're not physically in their bed while you're doing it because time and distance become void when you're in the astral plane. Always ask for protection, healing power and guidance from whomever you pray to and envision light; you can ask during astral projection as and when you wish. See light in your hands as white and strong as you can, and if you feel ready put one hand on their forehead and another on their abdomen and pour the light into them. Your intentions must be pure and you should be feeling nothing but love for them. Sometimes people will report back to you that something amazing has happened to them, even though you didn't tell them you were the source of it! Enjoy your astral journeys!""]"
Health,"['1. Ask your parents for their blood type. If your biological parents both know their blood type, that narrows down the possibilities. In most cases this is only enough to guess, using an online blood type calculator or the following list:\nFiguring Out Your Blood TypeO parent x O parent = O childO parent x A parent = A or O childO parent x B parent = B or O childO parent x AB parent = A or B childA parent x A parent = A or O childA parent x B parent = A, B, AB or O childA parent x AB parent = A, B or AB childB parent x B parent = B or O childB parent x AB parent = A, B or AB childAB parent x AB parent = A, B or AB childBlood types also include an ""Rh factor"" (+ or -). If both of your parents have an Rh- blood type (such as O- or AB-), you are also Rh-. If one or both of your parents are Rh+, you cannot tell whether you are + or - without a test.', ""2. Call a doctor who has drawn your blood. If your physician already has your blood type on file, then you just need to ask. However, they will only have your record on file if you've already had your blood drawn and/or tested. Common reasons why you may have already had your blood type tested include:\nPregnancy\nSurgery\nOrgan donations\nBlood transfusion"", '3. Buy a blood typing kit. If you don\'t want to visit a doctor or donate blood, you can find a home test kit online or at a pharmacy for as little as US $10. These typically instruct you to dampen various labeled patches on a special card, then prick your finger and add a little blood to each patch. Make sure to follow the kit instructions when adding the blood. Note which patches (or vials of fluid, in some kits) cause the blood to clump (agglutinate) instead of spreading out. The clumping is a reaction to substances incompatible with your blood type. Once you\'ve completed the test with all cards or fluids, look up your blood type using the kit instructions or the following list:\nUsing a Blood Typing KitKeep in mind that any test conducted at home is less reliable than a test performed by a professional. Check the ""Anti-A"" and ""Anti-B"" patches for clumps: Clumps in Anti-A (only) mean you have type A blood. Clumps in Anti-B mean you have type B blood. Clumps in Anti-A and Anti-B means you are type AB blood.Check the ""Anti-D"" patch: Clumps means you are Rh positive. Add a  to your blood type. No clumps means you are Rh negative. Add a  to your blood type.Clumping in control patch? If the control patch (normal paper) causes clumping, or if you are not sure whether the blood is clumping on any patch, try another card.', '1. Request a blood test from your doctor. If your doctor doesn\'t have your type on file, then you can also ask to get a blood test done. Call or visit your doctor\'s office and ask for a blood test to determine your blood type.\nTry saying something like, ""I want to find out what my blood type is. Would it be possible for the doctor to order a blood test to check my blood type?""', ""2. Visit a health clinic. If you don't have a primary care physician, then you can have a blood test done at a health clinic. Just visit a local health clinic and ask them to test your blood type.\nYou may want to call ahead first to see if this is something that the health clinic offers."", ""3. Donate blood. This is an easy way to determine your blood type and help other people, all at once! Find a local donation center or wait until your school, church or community center hosts a blood drive. When you go in, ask the staff if they can tell you your blood type. Your blood is typically not tested right away, so it can take up to a few weeks for them to mail or call you with the result.\nThings to Know Before Donating BloodEligibility requirements: To donate blood, you must be at least 16 years old (in most states), in good health, and you must weigh at least 110 lb (50 kg). Medications, low iron levels, and recent travel to foreign countries can also disqualify you from donating. You also cannot have donated blood within the last 56 days.Call ahead: Call the blood donation center ahead of time to make sure that they'll accept your blood type."", '4. Go to a blood service center in your country of residence. Blood service centers usually provide people with free resources for getting their blood tested and finding out their type.\nIn Canada, go to Canada\'s official blood website. Find out where the next ""What\'s Your Type?"" event is taking place.  These are regular promotional events hosted in the community by Canadian Blood Services.  Your results are instant and you will find out how common or rare your blood type is, who you can receive from, and who you can donate to.  You will learn both your ABO blood group, as well as your positive or negative Rhesus factor.']"
Personal Care and Style,"[""1. Be patient and let your facial hair grow. Your genetic profile is the primary factor in how quickly (and how fully) your beard grows, and there’s not much you can do about that. While you can take measures to support the process and increase the growth, you should also accept that your beard will grow in its own way and at its own pace.\nSome people say that regularly trimming your beard will stimulate faster growth, but there’s no evidence to support this.\nIt’s possible that frequent shaving before you start growing a beard may stimulate the hair follicles to grow faster, but the evidence for this is also limited at best.\nSo, once you start growing a beard, just let it grow!\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarlon Rivas\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProfessional Barber\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarlon Rivas is a Barber and Owner of MGX Professional Men's Grooming, a barbershop based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Wait for at least this long before you try any other treatments on your beard."", ""2. Wash your face twice per day to unblock hair follicles. Wet your face with warm water. If you haven’t started your beard yet, massage in a gentle face cleanser. If you do have a beard coming in, also use a mild shampoo on just the facial hair. Rinse the cleanser and/or shampoo away with cool, clean water, then pat your face dry with a soft towel. Do this every morning and evening.\nWashing your face regularly will help to remove dirt and oil from your hair follicles. This makes it easier for them to grow.\nTo test if a cleanser is gentle enough for your skin, apply a small amount to your chin and leave it for 10 minutes. If you don't have any signs of a reaction (like redness or irritation), you can try washing your face with the cleanser."", '3. Massage your face twice daily to stimulate the follicles. Apply firm but not painful pressure on your face with your fingertips, then massage in small circles over your beard-growing area. Do the massage for about 10 minutes, twice per day.\nTip: Regular facial massages may help to stimulate the hair follicles and encourage faster beard growth. And it definitely feels good!', '4. Exfoliate your face once per week. Wash your face as normal with your gentle cleanser or shampoo, but rinse with warm water and leave your skin damp. Gently massage in the exfoliant over your entire face (including any facial hair), then rinse it away completely with clean water and pat your face dry.\nExfoliating will help to clear away dead skin cells that may be impeding your hair follicles from achieving their full growth potential.\nBefore using an exfoliant on your entire face, test a small patch on your chin for 5-10 minutes. If you don’t feel any burning or irritation, you should be good to go.', '5. Pamper your growing beard with beard oil or softener. While you should be wary of any product claims made for stimulating beard growth, beard oils and beard softeners may, in fact, provide some benefits. Keeping your beard hairs soft and hydrated may encourage slightly faster growth.\nTip: If possible, choose a beard product that contains eucalyptus. There’s some evidence that it may actually help stimulate hair growth.\nAvoid beard oil if you have acne, though. It may worsen your breakouts.\nAt the very least, using beard products will make your beard look and feel better, no matter how fast it’s growing.', '6. Try homemade beard-stimulating recipes. As with most home remedies, the supporting evidence for beard stimulators is limited at best. They aren’t likely to cause any harm, though, so consider trying one or both of the following:\nCreate a thin paste out of 1 US tbsp (15 ml) of fresh-squeezed lime juice and 1 US tbsp (15 g) of ground cinnamon. Apply it to your beard in a thin layer, leave it for 20-30 minutes, then rinse it away and use your normal face cleanser. Use this paste 1-2 times per day, but stop if you notice any irritation.\nBlend 3 US tbsp (45 g) of dried mustard leaves with 2  fl oz (59 ml) of amla oil until it forms a smooth paste. Apply it in a thin layer over your beard, leave it for 15-20 minutes, then rinse it away and wash your face with your normal cleanser. Refrigerate any remaining paste and use it daily for 2-3 days.', '1. Eat more foods with vitamins B3, B5, B7, and B9. Several of the B vitamins promote healthy hair, so upping your intake may help your beard grow a bit faster and fuller. Biotin (Vitamin B7) seems particularly beneficial, so you may want to consult your doctor about taking a biotin supplement as well.\nNuts are a great source of biotin (Vitamin B7).\nYou’ll find vitamins B3 and B5 in chicken, beef, fish, dairy, and avocados.\nYou can get Vitamin B9 from cereals, nuts, and leafy greens.', '2. Increase your intake of vitamins A, C, and E. Like the B vitamins, each of these vitamins supports healthy hair in some fashion. They’re also important for your overall health.\nEat carrots, broccoli, and leafy greens for Vitamin A.\nChoose green peppers, tomatoes, and citrus for Vitamin C.\nPick beans, nuts, and leafy greens for Vitamin E.', '3. Eat a balanced diet overall to support beard health. While it may be helpful to target key vitamins, make sure you focus on eating a healthy diet that provides a wide variety of nutrients. Think of it this way—whatever is good for your body is good for your beard!\nEat lots of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats (like avocados and olive oil).\nCut back on processed foods, excess salt and sugar, and unhealthy fats (like saturated and trans fats in processed foods).\n\nDrink water to hydrate your body and your beard hair follicles.', '4. Follow health guidelines for exercise and sleep. Like eating a healthy diet, getting enough exercise and enough sleep are good for your overall health and your beard health. Aim for the following:\nGet at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week. Moderate intensity means your heart rate is elevated and you’re breathing hard enough that it’s tough to make conversation.\nDo 2-3 strength training sessions per week, each for 30-60 minutes.\nGet roughly 8 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night.', ""5. Reduce stress to encourage beard growth. You’ve probably heard that excessive stress can cause hair loss. It shouldn’t be surprising, then, that it might also slow down hair growth. That means the less you worry about your beard, the better it might grow!\nFind the stress reduction techniques that work best for you. Try things like yoga, meditation, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, nature walks, listening to calming music, talking to friends, or reading a good book.\nWork with your doctor and a mental health professional if you're having significant difficulty handling stress."", ""6. Stop smoking for your overall (and maybe beard) health. There’s no direct evidence that smoking is specifically bad for beard health. However, smoking is clearly bad for so many aspects of your overall health that it's not unreasonable to think it may hinder beard growth. Whether you're trying to grow a beard or not, focus on quitting as soon as possible.\nThere are numerous smoking cessation aids available today. Work with your doctor to find the right method (or combination of methods) for you.\nThere is some evidence that smoking may cause your beard hair to turn gray faster."", '1. Seek medical advice regarding your testosterone and DHT levels. Testosterone can be broken up into 2 types, often referred to as T and DHT. DHT levels impact beard hair density, while T impacts beard hair thickness. Managing T and DHT levels under medical supervision may enhance your beard growth.\nDo not use testosterone-boosting pills, creams, injections, or other products without the advice and guidance of your doctor. There can be a range of unwanted side effects, and you could end up impeding beard growth.\nYour doctor may recommend engaging in regular strength-training sessions as a way to naturally boost testosterone levels.', '2. Talk to your doctor about using minoxidil (Rogaine) on your face. Rogaine, the most common brand name for minoxidil, is widely used to slow the progress of male pattern baldness. If applied to the face properly, it should help stimulate beard growth. However, even though Rogaine is available over the counter in many areas, you should always consult your doctor before using it on your face.\nThis may be a better treatment option if you have patches where your beard doesn’t grow in well, as opposed to wanting your entire beard to grow in faster.\nIf and when you stop treatment, any new hair growth may fall out.', '3. Ask a medical expert about micro-needling to stimulate hair growth. Microneedling involves rolling a device on your face that’s similar to a lint roller—except instead of sticky paper on the roller, it has hundreds of tiny needle points. Some advocates for micro-needling believe the tiny pinpricks stimulate the hair follicles and enhance beard growth.\nSome dermatologists and cosmetic surgeons use in-office micro-needling to address issues like acne. Talk to a medical professional you trust before undergoing micro-needling treatments or buying a device yourself.\nIf used correctly, the process should be safe and relatively painless. However, it’s essential that the device is sanitized properly before each use according to the product instructions (usually by soaking it in alcohol).', '4. Look into facial hair transplants as a final option. If there are areas of your beard that simply won’t grow in, hair transplants may be your only choice. As with top-of-the-head hair transplants, individual hair follicles are relocated from one area (like the back of the neck) to another (like your cheek).\nHair transplants usually require multiple procedures that are both costly and time-consuming. It may take up to 2 years to see the full results, and the procedure doesn’t always work.\nTransplants may help fill in gaps in your beard, but it won’t make your beard grow faster.']"
Personal Care and Style,"['1. Squeeze the juice from three fresh lemons. Cut each lemon in half, then remove the seeds with the tip of the knife. Squeeze each half into a bowl or measuring cup. You may need slightly more or less, depending on the length of your hair.', '2. Add two parts lemon juice and one part leave-in conditioner to a spray bottle. Transfer the lemon juice into a clean spray bottle. Add a small amount of leave-in conditioner to the bottle. Replace the nozzle and give the bottle a good shake to mix the two ingredients together.\nIf you don’t have a leave-in conditioner, you can use water instead. However, leave-in conditioner is generally a better option because lemon juice can leave your hair dry and brittle.', '3. Protect your skin with a layer of sunscreen. You are going to use the power of sunlight to activate the lightening effects of the citric acid, so make sure that your skin is protected from harmful UVA and UVB rays. Slather a good sunscreen with a minimum of SPF 30 all over your face and body.\nBring the bottle with you outside, and reapply it if you sweat or go swimming.', '4. Spritz the mixture all over your hair for a full dye. For full coverage, spray the mixture on all of your hair and then give it a few light brushes. Make sure your hair is damp, but not soaked with the mixture.\nIf you just want to lighten your roots, tips or create highlighted streaks, concentrate the spray on those areas only.\nFor an ombre look, concentrate the spray on the bottom half of your hair.', ""5. Use a cotton ball soaked with the mixture to highlight specific strands. Once saturated with the mixture, slide the cotton ball down the strands you want to highlight. This will create highlighted streaks. Keep track of which strands you're working on, since you'll need several sessions to achieve significant results.\nTo make sure you don't double treat the same strands and forget to treat others, wrap foil around the strands you've already saturated with juice."", '6. Expose your hair to direct sunlight for 1-2 hours. Head outside for a couple of hours so the sunlight can activate the lemon juice, which creates the lightening effects. As the mixture dries on your hair, it will start to feel hard and a bit crunchy. This is normal! Tousle it with your hand, but don’t try to brush through it at this point.', '1. Rinse the lemon mixture out of your hair. After 1-2 hours of sunlight exposure, head back inside. Hop in the shower and rinse the mixture out of your hair. Lemon juice is very drying, so be sure to rinse it out thoroughly.', '2. Apply a deep conditioner. Once rinsed, saturate your hair from root to tip with a quality deep conditioner. Leave it on for about 10 minutes (or however long the product specifies). Rinse it out thoroughly.', '3. Dry and style your hair as you normally would. After the first session, you will already start to notice very subtle lightening effects! If your hair is still feeling a bit dry, apply a moisturizing product like a hydrating styling cream. You can also use a very small amount of the deep conditioner on the ends and to tame fly-aways.', '4. Repeat this ritual for 3-4 days in a row. Lightening with lemon juice is a process; it takes several sessions to get noticeable effects. Try applying this mixture and sitting out in the sun for 1-2 hours on four different occasions.\nYou can do this for several days in a row, or spread it out over the course of a week or so – whatever works for you.\nDeep condition your hair well after each session.', '5. Expect subtle changes in color. After about four sessions, you may notice your hair is about one shade lighter. If you started with dark brown hair, it will look light brown. Light brown hair will look dark blonde, dark blonde hair will be a lighter blonde, and lighter blonde will be closer to a white blonde. Red hair will gain golden highlights. If you began with black hair, you may see no results at all, unfortunately.\nLemon juice doesn’t work well with very dark hair.\nIf you do have black or extremely dark hair, be careful – sometimes lemon juice can make darker shades look brassy (orange-ish). Monitor the color after every session.', '6. Give your hair a few weeks of recovery time. Lemon juice will damage your hair over time. In fact, although it’s natural, some people believe that it’s just as damaging as bleach. After 3-4 sessions in a row, give your hair a break for several weeks. The lightening effects will be subtle but permanent, so work in stages.\nIf you want to continue lightening your hair with lemon juice after giving your hair a few weeks off, feel free. Just be sure you keep up with deep conditioning after every session.', '1. Add chamomile tea to your lemon mixture. Boil one cup of water. Add two chamomile tea bags and let them steep for 10 minutes. Remove the bags and add the tea to the lemon mixture in your spray bottle. Use this spray exactly the same way as before.\nChamomile tea works best on light brown or blonde hair.', '2. Add a teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Cinnamon is a natural lightening agent and may enhance the effects of your lemon juice spray. Create a fresh batch, then add about a teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the spray bottle. Shake well and apply as you normally would.', '3. Add a squirt of honey. Honey is a natural lightener and can also help condition your hair. After you’ve made your mixture and transferred it to the spray bottle, add a small squirt of honey. Replace the nozzle and give it a good shake. Proceed as your normally would.']"
Home and Garden,"['1. Make 2 rows of chairs with the backs facing each other. Chairs are a great option because their backs provide a high fort ceiling. Position the rows in front of a sofa, bed, or wall if you want the fort to be enclosed on the back side. Space the rows of chairs about 4 to 6 ft (1.2 to 1.8 m) apart depending on the size of your blanket.\nIf you don’t have chairs to support your fort, see what other sturdy items are in the room. Laundry hampers, ottomans, and boxes can serve as fort building materials. Place the items side-by-side if you need to use multiple pieces to create the fort.\nYou can use furniture of different heights to create high and low places in the fort, which makes it extra fun to crawl around inside. Make sure to choose furniture items that are tall enough so you will be able to crawl or sit under the blankets in the fort.Tip: Your blanket fort will need to have enough room for you to crawl and play in, so choose an area with plenty of space and avoid blocking doorways. The living room, dining room, or bedroom are all good options.', '2. Place blankets and pillows on the floor of the fort to make it comfortable. Fold a comforter in half and lay it down or layer a few blankets to add cushioning to the bottom the fort. Then, place several cushions or pillows around the edges of the fort.\nYou can also place extra blankets or sleeping bags in the fort to cover yourself up.\nIf the ceiling of your fort is high enough, you could even place a few low chairs or stools in the fort, such as bean bag chairs or ottomans.', '3. Drape a sheet or blanket over the furniture pieces. Drape a large sheet or blanket over the top of the fort so that it goes over the edges of the furniture. Pull the blanket or sheet taut so that it is not drooping down in the center of the fort’s ceiling.\nLayer more than 1 sheet or blanket over the furniture to provide a darker environment inside of the fort.\nUse a light-colored sheets to allow some light into the inside of the fort, or use a dark-colored sheet or blanket to make it darker in the fort.', '4. Secure the blankets with heavy objects or clothespins. The edges of the blanket will eventually slip off the furniture if you do not weigh them down. Grab a few books or other heavy objects and place them on the edges of the blanket. Clothes pins may be enough to secure the edges of a sheet on some types of furniture. For example, if you are using a couch as part of your fort base, then clip the sheet edge to the fabric on the couch using a clothes pin.\nPropping large pillows or couch cushions against the fort’s framework can also help to secure the blankets.', '1. Use an extendable curtain rod to support the ceiling in a small space. If you are building the fort in a hallway, closet, or other small space, then you can use an extendable shower rod as a support for the ceiling of your fort. Extend the curtain rod over the center of where you want the fort’s ceiling to be. Then, drape your blanket or sheet over the curtain rod. Use smaller pieces of furniture to support the lower portion of the sheet or blanket.\nThis fort is nice if you want to create a ceiling that is high enough to walk under.\nMake sure that the blanket or sheet you use is long enough to reach the floor.\nAvoid draping the blanket’s edges over any furniture that could easily fall over, such as small end tables.Safety Precaution: Make sure that the curtain rod is secure before you hang a sheet or blanket on it. Test it by tugging gently on the center to make sure it doesn’t fall down.', '2. Extend a clothesline across the room for an extra-large fort. If you want a large, long fort, then try stringing a clothesline from 1 end of your living room or bedroom to the other. Then, drape blankets and use smaller pieces of furniture to keep the blankets from caving in. This will allow you to create a fort that can span the entire length of a room.\nMake sure to hang the ends of the clothesline from something sturdy, such as a doorknob.\nYou could also extend 2 clotheslines running parallel to each other for a wider fort.', '3. Drape a blanket over a 4-legged table. A quick and easy way to make a fort is use a table as your base. Pull the chairs away from a 4-legged table and drape a large blanket over it. Your fort is complete!\nMake sure to choose a table that is high enough for you to fit underneath.\nUse a blanket that is large enough to cover all 4 sides of the table.', '1. Add lights to the fort. If you want to read inside your fort or play board games with siblings or friends, you may want to add some lights. Christmas lights look great, and they come in all sorts of colors. String the lights across the ceiling of the fort, or place them on the ground around the edges of the fort.\nYou could also place a few flameless candles or a battery-powered lantern inside of the fort.\nA flashlight works, too! Use it to light up your face while telling a spooky story.', '2. Create tunnels with boxes and additional blankets. If you have an empty box laying around, use it to connect your fort to a second fort, or simply make a tunnel going into the fort. Open up the top and bottom of the box and lay it on its side at the edge of the fort. Then, drape a blanket over the box to help it blend in with your fort.\nPlace multiple boxes in a row to make a longer tunnel into and out of your fort.', '3. Place a fan at the end of the opening to keep the space cool. Forts can get pretty hot, especially after a busy day of adventuring. Place a fan in front of the opening to the fort to help circulate air throughout it.\nDo not hang any blankets behind the fan or they may get stuck in it and break it.', '4. Bring games, books, and other types of entertainment into the fort. If you plan to spend some time relaxing in your fort, make sure to bring a variety of fun items into it. Bring a few board or card games into the fort if you will have friends or siblings in there with you, or bring a good book if you will be in the fort alone. You could also bring a tablet or laptop into the fort if you want to watch a movie or play games.Tip: Avoid bringing too many items or large bulky items into the fort. These will clutter the space and make it harder to move around.', '5. Stock your fort with snacks and drinks. You don’t want to have to leave the fort to get a drink of water or something to eat! Put some non-perishable drinks and snacks in the fort so you won’t have to go in search of food and drink for a while. Some good options include:\nWhole fruit, such as oranges, apples, or bananas\nPretzels\nChips\nCrackers\nCookies\nBeef jerky\nJuice boxes\nWater bottles']"
Food and Entertaining,"['1. Choose the ingredients you want to ferment into vodka. Vodka is commonly made from wheat, rye, barley, corn, or potatoes. Sugar and molasses can also be used alone or added to other ingredients. One distiller even makes an innovative vodka from Pinot Noir red wine. Whatever you choose, it must have sugars or starches so that alcohol is ultimately produced. Yeast eats sugars or starches and spits out alcohol and carbon dioxide.\nWhen making vodka from grains and potatoes, a mash must be made that contains active enzymes that break down the starches from the grains or potatoes and makes fermentable sugars.\nFruit juice already contains sugars so starch-degrading enzymes are not needed. As with fruit juice, vodka made from store-bought sugars need only be fermented, thus bypassing the need for a mash.\nWhen already fermented mediums such as wine are used, the medium can be distilled right away into vodka.', '2. Decide whether you need additional enzymes. Depending on what you decide to make your vodka out of, you may need to add enzymes to help convert the starches into sugar. If you’re using grains and potatoes, you’ll need additional enzymes. Grains and potatoes are sources of starch, so enzymes are needed to break the starch down into sugar.\nIf you’re using malted whole grains, you do not need additional enzymes. Malted whole grains, like malted barley or malted wheat, are rich in natural enzymes that break down starches into fermentable sugars.\nIf you’re using refined sugar and molasses, you do not need additional enzymes because the sugar is already present.', ""3. Add additional enzymes, if necessary. Food-grade amylase enzyme powder can be purchased from a homebrew shop and added to the mash to convert the starch into fermentable sugars, if you're using potatoes, for example. Use the recommended amount for the amount of starch to be broken down. There is no need to use malted, enzyme-rich grains such as malted barley or wheat when using enzyme powder.\nFor enzymes to be able to break down starches, the starches must first be gelatinized. Flaked (rolled) grains are often already gelatinized. Un-gelatinized ingredients such as potatoes and unrolled or malted grains are heated in water to the gelatinization temperature of the particular starch that is used.\nPotatoes usually gelatinize at about 150° F (66° C), and barley and wheat gelatinize at about the same temperature. Theoretically, a potato mash should only need to be heated to 150° F (66° C). If a low temperature is used with potatoes, the potatoes should be finely shredded before adding them to the water.\nStarch-degrading enzymes only work at specific temperatures and are destroyed at high temperatures. A temperature of 150° F (66° C) is common, but temperatures above 158° F (70° C) will result in the destruction of the enzymes. The absolute maximum temperature is 165° F (74° C)."", '1. Try a wheat mash. In a 10 gallon (38 L) metal pot with lid, heat 6 gallons (23 L) of water to about 165° F (74° C). Add 2 gallons (7.6 L) of dry, flaked wheat and stir. Check the temperature and ensure that it is between 150° F (66° C) and 155° F (68° C). Stir in 1 gallon (3.8 L) of crushed wheat malt. The temperature should be about 149° F (65°). Cover and let rest for 90 minutes to 2 hours, stirring occasionally.\nThe starches should convert into fermentable sugars during this time, and the mixture should become much less viscous.\nAfter 90 minutes to 2 hours, cool the mixture to 80° to 85° F (27° to 29° C). Use an immersion chiller for rapid cooling or just let it cool overnight, but don’t let it get much below 80° F (27° C).', '2. Go for a potato mash. Clean 20 pounds (9.1 kg) of potatoes. Without peeling, boil them in a large kettle until gelatinized, about one hour. Discard the water and thoroughly mash the potatoes by hand or with a food processor. Return the mashed potatoes to the kettle and add 5 to 6 gallons (19 to 23 L) of tap water. Mix to blend and bring mixture to just over 150° F (66° C).\nAdd 2 pounds (0.91 kg) of crushed, malted barley or wheat and stir well. Cover and stir periodically over the course of 2 hours. Let it cool overnight to 80° to 85° F (27° to 29° C).\nLetting it cool for a long period of time also gives the barley malt enzymes more time to break down the potato starch.', '3. Make a corn mash. Make a mash according to the wheat mash recipe, but substitute flaked, pre-gelatinized corn (maize) for the flaked wheat. Alternatively, sprout your own corn over the course of 3 days and make a mash from it without added malted grain. A root about 2 inches (5.1 cm) long should sprout from each grain.\nThe sprouted corn will contain enzymes that were formed during the germination (sprouting) process.', ""1. Clean all your utensils and prepare the area properly. Fermentation is conducted in clean, sanitized vessels that are sometimes open but often sealed from the air to prevent cross-contamination. Fermentation usually lasts for 3-5 days.\nFermentation is also possible in vessels that haven't been cleaned or sanitized, and the distilled product will yield drinkable alcohol, but the fermentation may result in a high level of unwanted flavor compounds and higher alcohols due to the action of unwanted yeast stains and bacteria.\nOxidative cleaners such as B-Brite are available at homebrew shops, as are sanitizers such as iodophor."", '2. Choose and set up your airlock. An airlock is a mechanism that will allow CO2 to escape without letting O2 to get in.  Five-gallon (19-L) batches of strained mash can be fermented in a 7.5-gallon (28-L) food-grade bucket or in 6-gallon (23-L) carboys. Lids can be affixed to buckets, as can drilled rubber stoppers to carboys, but when using a lid or a stopper, never seal the vessel completely, as pressure from carbon dioxide production will create explosive pressure.\nAlways affix an airlock to lids and drilled rubber stoppers to prevent explosive pressure from building.\nWhen fermentation is conducted in open vessels, put a cheesecloth over the vessel to keep out bugs and other undesirable things.', '3. Strain the mash or liquid into your fermentation vessel. If a mash was made, strain the liquid with a fine mesh strainer from the mash into your cleaned and sanitized fermentation vessel. Try to splash the liquid and pour it from a distance so that it is well aerated.\nYeast needs air (oxygen) initially to grow and start a quality fermentation. This is because yeast makes cellular material in the form of lipids from oxygen. However, oxygen is not desired after this initial growth stage, as yeast produces alcohol in the absence of oxygen.\nYou may want to add a sugar solution at this time. Aerate the sugar solution by pouring it from a distance into the fermentation vessel.\nIf juice is to be fermented, aerate by pouring from a height through a sieve or strainer into the fermentation vessel.', '4. Add yeast to the fermentable medium. Hydrate the appropriate amount of dried distillers or other desired yeast and add it to the liquid. Stir with a clean, sanitized spoon to evenly disperse the yeast. If using an airlock, the airlock will bubble during active fermentation, and the bubbling will slow dramatically or cease altogether as the liquid becomes completely fermented.\nKeep the fermenting liquid in a room that is about 80° to 85° F (27° to 29° C) to facilitate good, efficient fermentation. Alternately, use a heating belt in cold areas.\nDistillers yeast will ferment cleanly, produce a high amount of alcohol (ethanol), and produce a relatively low amount of unwanted compounds such as alcohols other than ethanol. The amount of yeast used will depend on the specific brand or type of yeast used.\nNutrients may be included with the yeast in the yeast packet. Yeast nutrients are needed when fermenting a medium that is low in nutrients, such as sugar solutions, but they can also improve fermentations when used with nutrient-rich mediums such as those made from grains.', '5. Collect the wash. Siphon off the fermented, alcoholic liquid (called the wash) into a cleaned and sanitized vessel or into the distillation apparatus. Leave the yeast sediment behind in the fermentation vessel, as it can scorch when heated in the still. The siphoned wash may also be further clarified by filtration or other means before distillation.', '1. Use a column still if possible. Column stills are more complex and sophisticated than pot stills. They can be purchased or, depending on the still design, built using readily available materials. However, column stills and pot stills work in a relatively similar manner.\nCooling water is usually circulated through a sealed compartment in the distillation column, causing the vaporized alcohol and other substances to condense in the column. This means that such a still must be attached directly to a faucet or a mechanical pump to move water from a supply into the still.\nIf not recirculating water from a single supply, thousands of gallons of water may need to be used to make a small batch of vodka. If water is recirculated from a central reservoir using a pump, about 50 gallons (189 L) of water can be used, but the water will heat up and become less effective.', '2. Opt for a pot still if you can’t find a column still. Simple pot stills are akin to pressure cookers that are attached to piping or tubing. They can be constructed very easily and cheaply. Unlike column stills that are essentially vertical columns, pot stills may utilize bent or coiled tubing or piping that can be submersed in a vessel of cooling water. Pumps and large volumes of cooling water are not required, but can be used.', '3. Use a reflux still, if necessary. A reflux still can do multiple distillations at one time. The packing between the condenser and the pot allows vapor to condense and trickle back down to the liquid pool. This “reflux” cleans the rising vapor and increases the purity of the vodka.', '1. Get ready for distillation. Stills heat the fermented, relatively-low alcoholic wash to a temperature that is greater than the boiling point of alcohol, yet less than the boiling point of water. In this way, the alcohol vaporizes while the bulk of the water does not. The vaporized alcohol (along with some vaporized water) travel up into the column, pipe or tube of the still.\nExternal cooling in the form of cold water is applied to the column, pipe, or tubing, causing the vaporized alcohol to cool and condense back into liquid. This alcoholic liquid is collected and becomes vodka.', '2. Heat the wash in the still to begin the distillation process. Depending on the type of still being used, gas burners, wood fires, or electric hot plates are all options. A temperature of about 173° F (78.3° C) at sea level is desirable, but the temperature must be kept below the boiling point of water, 212° F (100° C) at sea level.\nAs the wash becomes heated, alcohol and other substances vaporize and condense in the water-cooled area of the still.', '3. Throw out the heads. The first distilled liquid (called the “heads”) that is recovered from the still will be full of harmful methanol and other volatile chemicals that are toxic and can be fatal. For 5 gallons (19 L) of wash, discard at least the first 2 ounces (60 mL) of distillate.\nIt is extremely important that you do not drink this distilled liquid!', '4. Collect the body. After you discard the heads, the collected distillate will contain the desired alcohol (ethanol), along with some water and other compounds. This is called the “body” or the “heart.” During this time, if using a column still with flowing cold water, the water flow can be adjusted to control the distillate output and purity.\nAim for 2 to 3 teaspoons (9.8 to 14.8 mL) of distillate per minute. Increased distillate output results in decreased purity.', '5. Throw out the tails. Towards the end of the distillation process, when the temperature creeps up to 212° F (100° C) and beyond, the distillation process produces other nasty chemicals. These are called the “tails,” which contain fusel alcohols. The tails are undesirable as they contain propanol and butanol and should be discarded.\nAlways make sure to throw out the tails, as they should not be consumed!', '6. Check the alcohol content and purity of the distillate. Cool a sample of the distillate to 68° F (20° C) and use an alcometer to measure the percentage of alcohol of the distillate. The distillate may be too diluted to serve as acceptable vodka (weaker than 40% alcohol), or may be more concentrated than desired (perhaps higher than 50% alcohol).\nVodka is usually diluted before bottling, so the distillate may have a very high alcohol content. The distillate may also be too flavorful and aromatic and require additional distillations or carbon filtering.', '7. Redistill the liquid, if necessary or desired. This increases the alcohol content and further purifies the distillate. It is common to redistill the distillate 3 or more times to achieve vodka that has a high purity.\nKeep in mind that the heads and tails need to be discarded each time you distill the vodka!\nPremium brands of vodka go through 4 or 5 distillates, and most other brands go through 3 before the vodka is diluted and bottled.', '1. Filter the vodka through carbon. Pass the distillate through an activated carbon filter, such as those available at homebrewing shops, to remove unwanted volatile flavors and aromas. Carbon water filters can also be modified to purify the distillate.', '2. Dilute the vodka to the desired strength. Add purified water to the distillate to attain the desired alcohol percentage. Use an alcometer to measure the alcohol percentage several times throughout this process until you achieve the desired strength.', '3. Bottle the vodka. Fill bottles using a gravity bottle filler setup and cork or cap the bottles. Label the bottles with custom labels if desired. Some gravity fillers may consist of a 7.5 gallon (29 L) bottling bucket (with spigot), vinyl tubing, and a simple spring-loaded plastic bottle filler. Multiple-spout wine bottle fillers can also be used.']"
Hobbies and Crafts,"['1. Shuffle the deck. To play Solitaire, you will need a traditional 52-card pack of standard playing cards. Open your pack and discard the instruction and Joker cards. Before you start dealing, shuffle the cards a couple of times to make sure that the deck is all mixed up.', '2. Deal seven cards in a row. Deal the first card and place it face up on your left-hand side. Then, deal six more cards face-down in a row to the right of this card so that each card has its own spot.\nWhen you are finished, you should have seven cards total. The first one on the left should be facing up and the other six should be facing down.\nThe cards that you are dealing are called your “Tableau.” These are the main cards that you will use to play solitaire. When you are finished dealing all of the cards, your Tableau will look similar to an upside down staircase.', '3. Skip the first card and then deal six cards. Next, you will need to deal six more cards onto the stacks. Place the first card face up on the second stack of cards from the left. Then, deal one card face down card onto each of the stacks moving to the right.', '4. Count over to the third card and then deal five cards. Starting with the third stack over from the left, deal one card face up. Then, deal four more cards facing down on each of the stacks to the right of this stack.', '5. Deal four cards starting with the fourth stack. Starting with the fourth stack over from the left, deal one card face up onto this stack and then deal three cards facing down. Place one card onto each of the stacks to the right of this stack.', '6. Skip the first four cards and deal three. Count over to the fifth card from the left in your row of seven card stacks. Deal one card facing up on this stack and then deal one card facing down onto each of the two stacks to the right.', '7. Count over to the sixth card and then deal two. Next, count over to the sixth stack from the left and deal one card facing up onto this stack. Then, deal one card facing down onto the stack to the right of this stack. This stack should be the last one in your row of seven.', '8. Deal one last card face up. There should only be one stack left that does not have a face up card on it. This stack should be all the way on the right of your Tableau. Deal one card onto this stack facing up. Now this stack should have six cards facing down and one on top that is facing up.\nAfter you have dealt this last card, your Tableau is complete! Dealing the Tableau is the hardest part of setting up solitaire, so the next part will be easy.', '1. Place the remaining cards face down. After you have finished setting up your stacks, you can place the cards that you have left just above the Tableau on the left-hand side. This will be your “Stock” or “Hand” pile. You will draw cards from this pile as you play the game.\nIf you want to be extra sure that the cards are shuffled, then you can shuffle them again before placing your Stock pile. This is optional though.', '2. Identify the space for your discard pile. The discard pile, also known as the “Talon” or “Waste” pile, is where you will discard any cards that you draw and cannot use. At the start of your game, the Talon pile will be empty. Reserve a space next to your Stock pile to create your Talon pile during gameplay.\nThe Talon pile is usually just to the right of the Stock pile.\nWhen you have exhausted your Talon pile, you can flip it over (face down) onto the Stock pile space again and continue playing.', '3. Leave room for your Foundation piles. The Foundation piles are where you will place the cards that you will clear from the Tableau stacks as you play solitaire. At the start of your game, your Foundation piles will be empty, so you just need to reserve some space above your Tableau. Leave enough room to place four stacks of cards as you play.', '1. Learn the object. If you have never played solitaire before, then you will need to take a few minutes to learn how to play solitaire first. The object of a game of Solitaire is to transfer all of the cards in the deck and in the tableau stacks to your foundation piles. You begin the game with nothing in these piles and arrange cards in these stacks going from lowest to highest and separated by suit.\nFor example, one stack might begin with the ace of spades, so only the two of spades can be placed in this stack next. You cannot place the three of spades until the two of spades is in place.', '2. Draw and place cards. You will need to draw and place cards to play. Draw one card at a time and either play it on one of your stacks or discard it if you cannot use it. You can play a card on one of your tableau stacks if the color and sequence are right. The colors need to alternate between red and black.\nFor example, if one stack has a five of hearts on it and you draw a four of clubs, then you could play the four of clubs on the five of hearts.', '3. Move and flip face-up cards. You can move cards between stacks to expose face-down cards. When a face down card is exposed, then you can flip it over and use it.\nFor example, if one stack has a five of hearts on it and another stack has a six of spades on it, then you could move the five of hearts to the six of spades stack. This will expose a face-down card that you can then flip over and either leave it in place or use it.', '4. Reuse the discard pile. When you have exhausted the discard pile, then you can flip over the stack and begin using those cards again. Continue to draw one card at a time and to flip the deck each time you go through it.', '5. Transfer cards to the foundation piles to clear them. As you expose cards and draw cards, you will be able to transfer them to the foundation piles above your tableau stacks. Remember that each pile needs to begin with an ace card and there should only be one stack per suit.\nWhen each stack contains an ace through king set, then you will have won the game!']"
Education and Communications,"['1. Go for a walk in nature. Many haikus are inspired by objects in the natural world, such as trees, rocks, mountains, and flowers. To get ideas for your poem, take a walk in a park nearby or go for a hike in the woods. Head to a mountain trail or a body of water like a river, lake, or beach. Spend some time in nature and observe it so you can get ideas for the poem.\nIf you can’t go outside for a walk in an area with nature, try looking at nature photographs and art in books or online. Find a particular nature scene or object in nature like a tree or flower that inspires you.', '2. Focus on a season or seasonal event. Haikus can also be about a season, such as fall, spring, winter, or summer. You can also focus on a natural event that happens at a certain time of year, such as the blooming of the cherry blossom trees in your neighborhood or the salmon run in the river near your house.\nSeasonal haikus often focus on a specific detail about the season, naming the season in the poem. Writing about a season can be a fun way for you to describe a particular detail you love about that time of year.', '3. Choose a person or object as your subject. Haikus do not all have to be about nature or the seasons. You can also choose a particular person or object as an inspiration for the poem. Maybe you want to write a funny haiku about your dog. Or perhaps you want to write a thoughtful haiku about your childhood toy.\nTry to only focus on one person or one object in the poem. Haikus are short and you may not have enough space in three lines to write every thought you have about the person or object.', '4. Read examples of a haiku. To get a better sense of the genre, read haikus that are well known and considered good examples of the form. You can find examples in books or online. Read haikus that are about nature and other subjects. You may read:\nHaikus by the Japanese poet Matsuo Basho.\nHaikus by the Japanese poet Yosa Buson.\nHaikus by the Japanese poet Tagami Kikusha.\nHaikus by American poet Richard Wright.', '5. Focus on an event in your past or something that is troubling you. Try finding a resemblance to nature or a metaphor that expresses your feelings shortly. An example may look like this:\nBoom, boom, boom, bam, bam!\nMy head is a battleground\nWith countless outbursts', '1. Follow the line and syllable structure of a haiku. Haikus follow a strict form: three lines, with a 5-7-5 syllable structure. That means the first line will have five syllables, the second line will have seven syllables, and the last line will have five syllables.\nThe poem will have a total of seventeen syllables. To count syllables in a word, place your hand under your chin. Then, say the word. Every time your chin touches your hand, this is one syllable.\nA haiku does not have to rhyme or follow a certain rhythm as long as it adheres to the syllable count.', '2. Describe the subject with sensory detail. Haikus are meant to give the reader a brief sense of the subject using the senses. Think about how your subject smells, feels, sounds, tastes, and looks. Describe the subject using your senses so it comes alive for your reader and feels powerful on the page.\nFor example, you may write about the “musky scent of the pine needles” or the “bitter taste of the morning air.”\nIf you are writing a haiku about a particular subject, such as your dog, you may describe the “clacking of its nails on the tile” or the “damp fur of wet dog.”', '3. Use concrete images and descriptions. Avoid abstract or vague descriptions. Instead, go for concrete images that are easy for the reader to visualize. Rather than using metaphor or simile, try describing the subject with details that are particular and unique.\nAvoid wordy descriptions or elaborate language. Try using simple language so you can stick to the syllable count required for a haiku.\nDo not use cliches, or phrases that have become so familiar they lose their meaning. Instead, go for images and descriptions that feel unique.\nFor example, you may write, “Fall leaves brush the road” or “Dog chases a bright bluebird.”', '4. Write the poem in the present tense. Give the haiku immediacy by using the present tense, rather than the past tense. Using the present tense can also make your lines simple and easy to follow.', '5. End with a surprising last line. A good haiku will have an ending line that is intriguing and leaves the reader hanging. It may leave the reader with a surprising last image or reflect on the previous two lines in a surprising way.\nFor example, the haiku by Japanese poet Kobayashi Issa has a surprising last line: “Everything I touch/with tenderness, alas/pricks like a bramble.”', '1. Read the haiku out loud. Once you have a draft of the haiku done, read it aloud several times. Listen to how the haiku sounds. Make sure each line flows easily into one another and that the lines follow the 5-7-5 syllable count. The haiku should sound natural when read aloud.\nIf you notice any awkward or choppy lines, adjust them so they sound smooth. Replace any words that are too long or complicated. Make sure the haiku sounds pleasant when reading aloud.', '2. Show the haiku to others. Get feedback from others about the haiku. Ask friends, family members, and peers what they think of the haiku. Pose questions about whether the haiku embodies a moment in nature or a season.\nIf you wrote a haiku about a particular subject or object, ask others if they think the haiku does a good job of exploring it.', '3. Center the haiku on the page when it’s done. Place the haiku in the center of the page and center the lines so it forms a diamond shape. This is how haikus are traditionally formatted.\nYou can also add a short title at the top of the haiku, such as “Autumn” or “Dog.” Avoid long, wordy titles.\nMany haikus do not have titles. It is not absolutely necessary that you title your haiku poem.']"
Education and Communications,"['1. Write down your sample data set. In most cases, statisticians only have access to a sample, or a subset of the population they\'re studying. For example, instead of analyzing the population ""cost of every car in Germany,"" a statistician could find the cost of a random sample of a few thousand cars. He can use this sample to get a good estimate of German car costs, but it will likely not match the actual numbers exactly.\n\nExample: Analyzing the number of muffins sold each day at a cafeteria, you sample six days at random and get these results: 38, 37, 36, 28, 18, 14, 12, 11, 10.7, 9.9. This is a sample, not a population, since you don\'t have data on every single day the cafeteria was open.\n\nIf you have every data point in a population, skip down to the method below instead.', '2. Write down the sample variance formula. The variance of a data set tells you how spread out the data points are. The closer the variance is to zero, the more closely the data points are clustered together. When working with sample data sets, use the following formula to calculate variance:\n\ns2{\\displaystyle s^{2}} = /(n - 1)\n\ns2{\\displaystyle s^{2}} is the variance. Variance is always measured in squared units.\n\nxi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} represents a term in your data set.\n∑, meaning ""sum,"" tells you to calculate the following terms for each value of xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}}, then add them together.\nx̅ is the mean of the sample.\nn is the number of data points.', '3. Calculate the mean of the sample. The symbol x̅ or ""x-bar"" refers to the mean of a sample. Calculate this as you would any mean: add all the data points together, then divide by the number of data points.\n\nExample: First, add your data points together: 17 + 15 + 23 + 7 + 9 + 13 = 84Next, divide your answer by the number of data points, in this case six: 84 ÷ 6 = 14.Sample mean = x̅ = 14.\nYou can think of the mean as the ""centre-point"" of the data. If the data clusters around the mean, variance is low. If it is spread out far from the mean, variance is high.', ""4. Subtract the mean from each data point. Now it's time to calculate xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅, where xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} is each number in your data set. Each answer tells you that number's deviation from the mean, or in plain language, how far away it is from the mean..\n\nExample:x1{\\displaystyle x_{1}} - x̅ = 17 - 14 = 3x2{\\displaystyle x_{2}} - x̅ = 15 - 14 = 1x3{\\displaystyle x_{3}} - x̅ = 23 - 14 = 9x4{\\displaystyle x_{4}} - x̅ = 7 - 14 = -7x5{\\displaystyle x_{5}} - x̅ = 9 - 14 = -5x6{\\displaystyle x_{6}} - x̅ = 13 - 14 = -1\nIt's easy to check your work, as your answers should add up to zero. This is due to the definition of mean, since the negative answers (distance from mean to smaller numbers) exactly cancel out the positive answers (distance from mean to larger numbers)."", '5. Square each result. As noted above, your current list of deviations (xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅) sum up to zero. This means the ""average deviation"" will always be zero as well, so that doesn\'t tell use anything about how spread out the data is. To solve this problem, find the square of each deviation. This will make them all positive numbers, so the negative and positive values no longer cancel out to zero.\n\nExample:(x1{\\displaystyle x_{1}} - x̅)2=32=9{\\displaystyle ^{2}=3^{2}=9}(x2{\\displaystyle (x_{2}} - x̅)2=12=1{\\displaystyle ^{2}=1^{2}=1}9 = 81(-7) = 49(-5) = 25(-1) = 1\nYou now have the value (xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} for each data point in your sample.', ""6. Find the sum of the squared values. Now it's time to calculate the entire numerator of the formula: ∑[(xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}}]. The upper-case sigma, ∑, tells you to sum the value of the following term for each value of xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}}. You've already calculated (xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - x̅)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} for each value of xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} in your sample, so all you need to do is add the results together.\n\nExample: 9 + 1 + 81 + 49 + 25 + 1 = 166."", ""7. Divide by n - 1, where n is the number of data points. A long time ago, statisticians just divided by n when calculating the variance of the sample. This gives you the average value of the squared deviation, which is a perfect match for the variance of that sample. But remember, a sample is just an estimate of a larger population. If you took another random sample and made the same calculation, you would get a different result. As it turns out, dividing by n - 1 instead of n gives you a better estimate of variance of the larger population, which is what you're really interested in. This correction is so common that it is now the accepted definition of a sample's variance.\n\nExample: There are six data points in the sample, so n = 6.Variance of the sample = s2=1666−1={\\displaystyle s^{2}={\\frac {166}{6-1}}=} 33.2"", ""8. Understand variance and standard deviation. Note that, since there was an exponent in the formula, variance is measured in the squared unit of the original data. This can make it difficult to understand intuitively. Instead, it's often useful to use the standard deviation. You didn't waste your effort, though, as the standard deviation is defined as the square root of the variance. This is why the variance of a sample is written s2{\\displaystyle s^{2}}, and the standard deviation of a sample is s{\\displaystyle s}.\nFor example, the standard deviation of the sample above = s = √33.2 = 5.76."", '1. Start with a population data set. The term ""population"" refers to the total set of relevant observations. For example, if you\'re studying the age of Texas residents, your population would include the age of every single Texas resident. You would normally create a spreadsheet for a large data set like that, but here\'s a smaller example data set:\n\nExample: There are exactly six fish tanks in a room of the aquarium. The six tanks contain the following numbers of fish:x1=5{\\displaystyle x_{1}=5}x2=5{\\displaystyle x_{2}=5}x3=8{\\displaystyle x_{3}=8}x4=12{\\displaystyle x_{4}=12}x5=15{\\displaystyle x_{5}=15}x6=18{\\displaystyle x_{6}=18}', '2. Write down the population variance formula. Since a population contains all the data you need, this formula gives you the exact variance of the population. In order to distinguish it from sample variance (which is only an estimate), statisticians use different variables:\nσ2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = /n\nσ2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = population variance. This is a lower-case sigma, squared. Variance is measured in squared units.\n\nxi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} represents a term in your data set.\nThe terms inside ∑ will be calculated for each value of xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}}, then summed.\nμ is the population mean\nn is the number of data points in the population', '3. Find the mean of the population. When analyzing a population, the symbol μ (""mu"") represents the arithmetic mean. To find the mean, add all the data points together, then divide by the number of data points.\nYou can think of the mean as the ""average,"" but be careful, as that word has multiple definitions in mathematics.\n\nExample: mean = μ = 5+5+8+12+15+186{\\displaystyle {\\frac {5+5+8+12+15+18}{6}}} = 10.5', '4. Subtract the mean from each data point. Data points close to the mean will result in a difference closer to zero. Repeat the subtraction problem for each data point, and you might start to get a sense of how spread out the data is.\n\nExample:x1{\\displaystyle x_{1}} - μ = 5 - 10.5 = -5.5x2{\\displaystyle x_{2}} - μ = 5 - 10.5 = -5.5x3{\\displaystyle x_{3}} - μ = 8 - 10.5 = -2.5x4{\\displaystyle x_{4}} - μ = 12 - 10.5 = 1.5x5{\\displaystyle x_{5}} - μ = 15 - 10.5 = 4.5x6{\\displaystyle x_{6}} - μ = 18 - 10.5 = 7.5', '5. Square each answer. Right now, some of your numbers from the last step will be negative, and some will be positive. If you picture your data on a number line, these two categories represent numbers to the left of the mean, and numbers to the right of the mean. This is no good for calculating variance, since these two groups will cancel each other out. Square each number so they are all positive instead.\n\nExample:(xi{\\displaystyle x_{i}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} for each value of i from 1 to 6:(-5.5)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = 30.25(-5.5)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = 30.25(-2.5)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = 6.25(1.5)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = 2.25(4.5)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = 20.25(7.5)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} = 56.25', '6. Find the mean of your results. Now you have a value for each data point, related (indirectly) to how far that data point is from the mean. Take the mean of these values by adding them all together, then dividing by the number of values.\n\nExample:Variance of the population = 30.25+30.25+6.25+2.25+20.25+56.256=145.56={\\displaystyle {\\frac {30.25+30.25+6.25+2.25+20.25+56.25}{6}}={\\frac {145.5}{6}}=} 24.25', ""7. Relate this back to the formula. If you're not sure how this matches the formula at the beginning of this method, try writing out the whole problem in longhand:\nAfter finding the difference from the mean and squaring, you have the value (x1{\\displaystyle x_{1}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}}, (x2{\\displaystyle x_{2}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}}, and so on up to (xn{\\displaystyle x_{n}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}}, where xn{\\displaystyle x_{n}} is the last data point in the set.\nTo find the mean of these values, you sum them up and divide by n: ( (x1{\\displaystyle x_{1}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} + (x2{\\displaystyle x_{2}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} + ... + (xn{\\displaystyle x_{n}} - μ)2{\\displaystyle ^{2}} ) / n\nAfter rewriting the numerator in sigma notation, you have /n, the formula for variance.""]"
Education and Communications,"['1. Choose an event with mutually exclusive outcomes. Probability can only be calculated when the event whose probability you’re calculating either happens or doesn’t happen. The event and its opposite both cannot occur at the same time. Rolling a 5 on a die, a certain horse winning a race, are examples of mutually exclusive events. Either a 5 is rolled or it isn’t; either the horse wins or it doesn’t.\nExample: It would be impossible to calculate the probability of an event phrased as: “Both a 5 and a 6 will come up on a single roll of a die.”', '2. Define all possible events and outcomes that can occur. Let’s say you\'re trying to find the likelihood of rolling a 3 on a 6-sided die. “Rolling a 3” is the event, and since we know that a 6-sided die can land any one of 6 numbers, the number of outcomes is 6. So, we know that in this case, there are 6 possible events and 1 outcome whose probability we’re interested in calculating. Here are 2 more examples to help you get oriented:\n\nExample 1: What is the likelihood of choosing a day that falls on the weekend when randomly picking a day of the week? ""Choosing a day that falls on the weekend"" is our event, and the number of outcomes is the total number of days in a week: 7.\n\nExample 2: A jar contains 4 blue marbles, 5 red marbles and 11 white marbles. If a marble is drawn from the jar at random, what is the probability that this marble is red? ""Choosing a red marble"" is our event, and the number of outcomes is the total number of marbles in the jar, 20.', ""3. Divide the number of events by the number of possible outcomes. This will give us the probability of a single event occurring. In the case of rolling a 3 on a die, the number of events is 1 (there’s only a single 3 on each die), and the number of outcomes is 6. You can also express this relationship as 1 ÷ 6, 1/6, 0.166, or 16.6%. Here's how you find the probability of our remaining examples:\n\nExample 1: What is the likelihood of choosing a day that falls on the weekend when randomly picking a day of the week? The number of events is 2 (since 2 days out of the week are weekends), and the number of outcomes is 7. The probability is 2 ÷ 7 = 2/7. You could also express this as 0.285 or 28.5%.\n\nExample 2: A jar contains 4 blue marbles, 5 red marbles and 11 white marbles. If a marble is drawn from the jar at random, what is the probability that this marble is red? The number of events is 5 (since there are 5 red marbles), and the number of outcomes is 20. The probability is 5 ÷ 20 = 1/4. You could also express this as 0.25 or 25%."", ""4. Add up all possible event likelihoods to make sure they equal 1. The likelihood of all possible events needs to add up to 1 or to 100%. If the likelihood of all possible events doesn't add up to 100%, you've most likely made a mistake because you've left out a possible event. Recheck your math to make sure you’re not omitting any possible outcomes.\nNote: If you had, for example, forgotten about the number 4 on the dice, adding up the probabilities would only reach 5/6 or 83%, indicating a problem.\nFor example, the likelihood of rolling a 3 on a 6-sided die is 1/6. But the probability of rolling all five other numbers on a die is also 1/6. 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 6/6 , which = 100%."", '5. Represent the probability of an impossible outcome with a 0. This just means that there is no chance of an event happening, and occurs anytime you deal with an event that simply cannot happen. While calculating a 0 probability is not likely, it’s not impossible either.\nFor example, if you were to calculate the probability of the Easter holiday falling on a Monday in the year 2020, the probability would be 0 because Easter is always on a Sunday.', '1. Deal with each probability separately to calculate independent events. Once you’ve figured out what these probabilities are, you’ll calculate them separately. Say you wanted to know the probability of rolling a 5 twice consecutively on a 6-sided die. You know that the probability of rolling one five is 1/6, and the probability of rolling another five with the same die is also 1/6. The first outcome doesn’t interfere with the second.\nNote: The probability of the 5s being rolled are called independent events, because what you roll the first time does not affect what happens the second time.', ""2. Consider the effect of prior events when calculating probability for dependent events. If the occurrence of 1 event alters the probability of a second event occurring, you are measuring the probability of dependent events. For example, if you choose 2 cards out of a deck of 52 cards, when you choose the first card, that affects what cards are available when you choose the second card. To calculate the probability for the second of two dependent events, you’ll need to subtract 1 from the possible number of outcomes when calculating the probability of the second event.\n\nExample 1: Consider the event: Two cards are drawn randomly from a deck of cards. What is the likelihood that both cards are clubs? The likelihood that the first card is a club is 13/52, or 1/4. (There are 13 clubs in every deck of cards.)\nNow, the likelihood that the second card is a club is 12/51, since 1 club will have already been removed. This is because what you do the first time affects the second. If you draw a 3 of clubs and don't put it back, there will be one less club and one less card in the deck (51 instead of 52).\n\nExample 2: A jar contains 4 blue marbles, 5 red marbles, and 11 white marbles. If 3 marbles are drawn from the jar at random, what is the probability that the first marble is red, the second marble is blue, and the third is white?\nThe probability that the first marble is red is 5/20, or 1/4. The probability of the second marble being blue is 4/19, since we have 1 less marble, but not 1 less blue marble. And the probability that the third marble is white is 11/18, because we’ve already chosen 2 marbles."", '3. Multiply the probabilities of each separate event by one another. Regardless of whether you’re dealing with independent or dependent events, and whether you’re working with 2, 3, or even 10 total outcomes, you can calculate the total probability by multiplying the events’ separate probabilities by one another. This will give you the probability of multiple events occurring one after another. So, for the scenario; What is the probability of rolling two consecutive fives on a six-sided die? the probability of both independent events is 1/6. This gives us 1/6 x 1/6 = 1/36. You could also express this as 0.027 or 2.7%.\n\nExample 1: Two cards are drawn randomly from a deck of cards. What is the likelihood that both cards are clubs? The probability of the first event happening is 13/52. The probability of the second event happening is 12/51. The probability is 13/52 x 12/51 = 12/204 = 1/17. You could also express this as 0.058 or 5.8%.\n\nExample 2: A jar contains 4 blue marbles, 5 red marbles and 11 white marbles. If three marbles are drawn from the jar at random, what is the probability that the first marble is red, the second marble is blue, and the third is white? The probability of the first event is 5/20. The probability of the second event is 4/19. And the probability of the third event is 11/18. The probability is 5/20 x 4/19 x 11/18 = 44/1368 = 0.032. You could also express this as 3.2%.', '1. Set the odds as a ratio with the positive outcome as a numerator. For example, let’s return to our example dealing with colored marbles. Say you want to figure out the probability of drawing a white marble (of which there are 11) out of the total pot of marbles (which contains 20). The odds of the event happening is the ratio of the probability that it will occur over the probability that it will not occur. Since there are 11 white and 9 non-white marbles, you’ll write the odds as the ratio 11:9.\nThe number 11 represents the likelihood of choosing a white marble and the number 9 represents the likelihood of choosing a marble of a different color.\nSo, odds are that you will draw a white marble.', '2. Add the numbers together to convert the odds to probability. Converting odds is pretty simple. First ,break the odds into 2 separate events: the odds of drawing a white marble (11) and the odds of drawing a marble of a different color (9). Add the numbers together to calculate the number of total outcomes. Write this as a probability, with the newly calculated total number of outcomes as the denominator\nThe event that you’ll draw a white marble is 11; the event another color will be drawn is 9. The total number of outcomes is 11 + 9, or 20.', '3. Find the odds as if you were calculating the probability of a single event. You have calculated that there are a total of 20 possibilities and that, essentially, 11 of those outcomes are drawing a white marble. So, the probability of drawing a white marble can now be approached like any other single-event probability calculation. Divide 11 (number of positive outcomes) by 20 (number of total events) to get the probability.\nSo, in our example, the probability of drawing a white marble is 11/20. Divide this out: 11 ÷ 20 = 0.55 or 55%.']"
Hobbies and Crafts,"['1. Make a lower case T-shape with your sticks. Take the 20 inches (51 cm) stick and put it across the 24 inches (61 cm) stick so that you create a lowercase T-shape with them. These sticks are the frame for your kite.\nIf you want to make a larger kite, use longer sticks. Make sure the horizontal stick is at least 4 inches (10 cm) shorter than the vertical stick.', '2. Attach the 2 sticks together with string and glue. Wrap twine around the 2 pieces in the middle 1-2 times. Then, tie the string or twine with a small knot and trim off excess string with scissors. You can also put a dab of super glue between the 2 pieces and press them together at the joint so they are secure.\nMake sure the sticks form a right angle to each other when they are attached. The horizontal stick should be positioned straight across the vertical stick.', '3. Make 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) horizontal notches at the end of each stick. Use scissors to make 1 notch at the end of each stick. These notches should run horizontally, or across the width of the stick. Make them deep enough to fit the string you are going to use to attach the sail.\nIf you are using very thin sticks and thin string, you can poke holes into the ends of the sticks instead of making notches.', '4. Stretch the string around the frame. Loop the string around the top notch on the frame, wrapping it once around the stick. Then, pull the string through the notch on the right end of the frame. Stretch the string to the notch at the bottom end of the frame and then through the left end of the frame. Finally, wrap the string 1-2 times around the top end of the frame. Remove any excess string with scissors.\nMake sure the string is taut but not too tight to prevent the sticks from bending or warping.\nThe string helps the frame to retain its shape as the kite flies in the air.', '1. Use a plastic bag, paper, or fabric that is 40 inches (100 cm) wide for the sail. A large, white garbage bag is the best option, as it is durable and easy to decorate. You can also use strong white contact paper or newspaper.\nFabric can also work for the sail in a pinch, though it should be thick and sturdy so the sail is strong.', '2. Lay the frame on the sail. Spread the material you are using for the sail flat on the ground. Then, place the frame in the center of the sail.', '3. Outline the frame with a ruler. Place the ruler on the top of the frame and then down the end of the stick on the right side of the frame. Use a pen or pencil to draw diagonal line from the top end to the end of the stick on the right, using the ruler as a guide. Do this again from the right end to the bottom end of the frame as well as from the bottom end to the left end. Finish by drawing a diagonal line from the left end up to the top end of the frame.\nYou should have a diamond shape on the sail, with the frame in the middle of the diamond.', '4. Cut the diamond 2 inches (5.1 cm) wider than the outline. Use scissors to cut out the diamond, leaving a bit of space around the outline so you can wrap the sail to the frame easily.\nYou should now have a nice, clean diamond sail that can fit snugly over the frame.', '1. Fold the edge of the sail over the frame and glue and tape it down. Run a thin line of super glue on the frame and press the edge of the sail on the frame to keep it in place. You can also use masking tape or electrical tape to secure the sail to the frame, taping the edge onto the inside of the sail.\nCheck that the sail sits tightly over the frame, as you do not want to come loose in the air.', '2. Attach the flying line. Use string that is at least 20 inches (51 cm) long for the flying line. Poke a small hole right above where the 2 sticks meet with scissors. The hole should be big enough to fit the flying line. Then, pull one end of the flying line through the hole and tie it tightly around the cross point. Let the flying line hang down freely while you finish the rest of the kite.\nYou can then add string to the flying line to make it longer based on your arm length and height. Sometimes, adding more string to the flying line can also help the kite to fly straighter.', '3. Make a kite tail with a 6 feet (1.8 m) long piece of thick string. Attach the tail to the bottom end of the frame, looping it over the frame several times and tying it tightly. Use thick string or a strip of cloth for the tail.\nPick a string or cloth color that matches the color of your sail so your kite looks pretty in the air.', '4. Attach pieces of cloth or ribbon to the tail at 1 foot (0.30 m) intervals. Use pieces that are 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) long. Tie them onto the tail with a small knot, allowing them to dangle down off the string. The cloth or ribbon pieces will help the tail stay balanced and ensure the kite flies straight.', '5. Decorate the kite with markers or colored paper. Once you have finished putting the kite together, get creative by writing inspirational words or phrases on it with markers. You can also color your kite with markers, creating a fun pattern like stripes or dots. Try gluing shapes made from colored paper like swirls, triangles, or circles onto the sail.\nYou can also write your name on the kite so everyone knows it belongs to you and you can see your name flying in the air.', '6. Try out the kite in a spot with no trees or power lines. Look for an area close to a body of water like a lake or the ocean, as it will have good winds for kite flying. Hold tight to the kite string and run in the direction of the wind. Then, release the kite as you are running, pushing it upward into the wind. Use the flying line to keep the kite in the air.']"
Computers and Electronics,"[""1. Run a UNIX-like OS, such as Linux. UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems are the operating systems of the Internet. While you can learn to use the Internet without knowing UNIX, you can't be an Internet hacker without understanding UNIX. For this reason, the hacker culture today is pretty strongly UNIX-centered. There are many types of UNIX-like operating systems, the most popular being Linux, which you can run alongside Microsoft Windows on the same machine. Download Linux online or find a local Linux user group to help you with installation.\nA good way to dip your toes in the water is to boot up a device called a live CD or USB, a distribution that runs entirely off a CD or USB without modifying your hard disk. A way to get a look at the possibilities without having to do anything drastic.\nThere are other UNIX-like operating systems besides Linux, such as the *BSD systems. The most popular *BSD systems are FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD. All are open source just like Linux. However, it's important to remember that they are BSD and not Linux.\nMacOS on Darwin, a UNIX operating system that's on FreeBSD. Darwin is fully free and open source and is available from http://opensource.apple.com. Because the core of the system is UNIX, and macOS is very popular, many people have ported over Linux applications to macOS. You can get those programs with a package manager like homebrew, fink or MacPorts. Alternatively, you can just run Linux on a Mac alongside macOS.\nIf you want to get super niche, you can even run an operating system like Open Indiana, which is based on the open source release of the Solaris operating system before it was acquired by Oracle and made closed source. OpenIndiana and Solaris made on UNIX System V, and, as such, are not compatible with  Linux applications. That said, there are many ports of Linux applications.

Think creatively. Now that you\'ve got the basic skills in place, you can start thinking artistically. Hackers are like artists, philosophers, and engineers all rolled up into one. They believe in freedom and mutual responsibility. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved. Hackers take a special delight in solving problems, sharpening their skills, and exercising their intelligence.\nHackers have a diversity of interests culturally and intellectually, outside of hacking. Work as intensely as you play, and play as intensely as you work. For true hackers, the boundaries between ""play,"" ""work,"" ""science,"" and ""art"" all tend to disappear or to merge into a high-level creative playfulness.\nRead science fiction. Go to science fiction conventions, which is a great way to meet hackers and proto-hackers.\nConsider training in a martial art. The kind of mental discipline required for martial arts seems to be similar in important ways to what hackers do. The most hacker-ly martial arts are those which emphasize mental discipline, relaxed awareness, and control, rather than raw strength, athleticism, or physical toughness.  Tai Chi is a good martial art for hackers.', '2. Learn to love solving problems. No problem should ever have to be solved twice. Think of it as a community in which the time of everyone is hackers is precious. Hackers believe sharing information is a moral responsibility. When you solve problems, make the information public to help everyone solve the same issue.\nYou don\'t have to believe that you\'re obligated to give all your creative product away, though the hackers that do are the ones that get the most respect from other hackers. It\'s consistent with hacker values to sell enough of it to keep you in food and rent and computers.\nRead older pieces, such as the ""Jargon File"" or ""Hacker Manifesto"" by The Mentor. They may be out of date regarding technical issues, but the attitude and spirit are just as timely.', '3. Learn to recognize and fight authority. The enemy of the hacker is boredom, drudgery, and authoritarian figures who use censorship and secrecy to strangle the freedom of information. Monotonous work keeps the hacker from hacking.\nEmbracing hacking as a way of life is to reject so-called ""normal"" concepts of work and property, choosing instead to fight for equality and common knowledge.', '4. Be competent. So, anyone who spends time on Reddit can write up a ridiculous cyberpunk username and pose as a hacker. But the Internet is a great equalizer and values competence over ego and posture. Spend time working on your craft and not your image, and you\'ll more quickly gain respect than modeling yourself on the superficial things we think of ""hacking"" in popular culture.', ""1. Write open-source software. Write programs that other hackers think are fun or useful, and give the program sources away to the whole hacker culture to use. Hackerdom's most revered demigods are people who have written large, capable programs that met a widespread need and given them away so that now everyone uses them."", ""2. Help test and debug open-source software. Any open-source author who's thinking will tell you that good beta-testers (who know how to describe symptoms, localize problems well, can tolerate bugs in a quickie release, and are willing to apply a few simple diagnostic routines) are worth their weight in rubies.\nTry to find a program under development that you're interested in and be a good beta-tester. There's a natural progression from helping test programs to helping debug them to helping modify them. You'll learn a lot this way, and generate goodwill with people who will help you later on."", '3. Publish useful information. Another good thing is to collect and filter useful and interesting information into web pages or documents like Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) lists, and make those available. Maintainers of major technical FAQs get almost as much respect as open-source authors.', ""4. Help keeps the infrastructure working.  Volunteers run the hacker culture (and the engineering development of the Internet, for that matter). There's a lot of necessary but unglamorous work that needs to be done to keep it going — administering mailing lists, moderating newsgroups, maintaining large software archive sites, developing RFCs and other technical standards. People who do this sort of thing well get a lot of respect, because everybody knows these jobs are huge time sinks and not as much fun as playing with code. Doing them shows dedication."", ""5. Serve the hacker culture itself. It is not something you'll be positioned to do until you've been around for a while and become well-known for one of the four previous items. The hacker culture doesn't have leaders, exactly, but it does have culture heroes and tribal elders and historians and spokespeople. When you've been in the trenches long enough, you may grow into one of these. \nHackers distrust blatant ego in their tribal elders, so visibly reaching for this kind of fame is dangerous. Rather than striving for it, you have to position yourself, so it drops in your lap, and then be modest and gracious about your status.""]"
Hobbies and Crafts,"['1. Fold an 8 ½ in x 11 in (21.5 cm x 28 cm) sheet of paper in half. Lay the paper down vertically and fold it from left to right so that its corners meet up. You can use ordinary white printer paper, construction paper, or origami paper. This is called folding the paper ""hot dog style."" Make a neat crease along the paper.\nTo strengthen the crease, run your finger down the fold 3-4 more times.', '2. Unfold the paper, rotate it 90 degrees, and fold it in half again. At this point, the paper should be lying down horizontally. Once you’ve adjusted the paper, fold from left to right. This ""hamburger style"" fold will create a new crease in the center of the page.\nYou should now have 2 creases along both centers (x-axis and y-axis) of the page.', '3. Flip the paper so that the fold opens toward you. Then, fold down the top corners towards the middle of the paper while leaving 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) of space at the bottom. Make sure the folds line up with the center crease. Crease along the edges to secure the folds.\nUse the crease you made before to help line up the folds coming in from the corners.', '4. Bring the bottom of the paper up to fold it against both sides. Grab the flap at the bottom of the paper and fold it up against the bottom of the 2 folded triangles. Turn the paper over and do the same thing to the flap on that side. This will make a paper hat.\nThe 2 folds should line up with each other.Tip: When you go to fold the second side, use the first fold as a reference point.', '5. Take the bottom corners and fold them in. On 1 side of the paper, grab the corners of the rectangle that are sticking out over the triangle. Wrap these parts of the paper around the edges of the triangle and crease them so that they stay wrapped around the edge of the triangle. Then, fold the bottom flaps around the edges of the triangle and back towards you.\nTake it a step further: Try out our new wikiHow Origami for Beginners Course! Learn popular origami and test your hand at more advanced figures.Take it a step further: Watch this video for access to our origami class\nThe flaps closest to you should be folded in front of the back flaps, not over them. If you fold over the back flaps, you won’t be able to fold the back flaps themselves.', '1. Make the triangle into a square. Pick up the triangle, rotate it 45 degrees, then use your fingers to open up the bottom of the triangle. Pull the paper apart gently until it pops into a square shape. Make sure the bottom corners of the triangle fold over each other and become the bottom corner of a diamond.\nCrease the paper along its edges so that it stays in the square shape.', '2. Fold up the bottom flaps. Arrange your paper so that the bottom points of the diamond can fold upward.  Fold up 1 corner, aligning it with the top corner. Then, flip the paper over and do the same thing to the other side.\nThe bottom of the diamond should be the part of the paper with extra folds.', '3. Construct the triangle into a square again. Just like last time, pick up the triangle, rotate it 45 degrees, then open up the bottom of your new triangle with your fingers. Crease the paper along its edges so that it stays in the square shape.\nThe bottom corners will line up to become the bottom point of a square diamond.', '4. Pull out the triangles on the side of the square. Start at the top of the diamond, and gently pull the two sides apart so that the seam running down the middle of the diamond blooms. Crease the bottom of the folded out sides to make the boat a bit stronger.\nYou may need to pull up the triangle inside the diamond while pulling apart the two sides. Try to keep the triangle inside the diamond sticking straight up as this will be your boat\'s ""mast.""', '5. Float your boat. Fill a small tub with water and place the boat on the water. If it starts to droop a little, keep making small adjustments to keep the sides up and prevent the boat from sinking.\nYou can reinforce the corners with clear tape and tape around the bottom to keep your boat dry.Tip: Waterproof your boat! Use a waxed paper from an art store to make your boat last longer, or color one side of the paper completely with a crayon.  You can also try to make your boat out of aluminum foil.']"
Computers and Electronics,"['1. Find out which type of touch screen your device uses. There are several different types of touch screens and your homemade stylus may not work with all of them.\niPhones, iPads, Androids, Kindles, and many other smartphones and tablets have a capacitive touch screen, which needs an electrical conductor (like the human body) to register where contact is made.\nNintendo DS, The 3Ds, the Nook, and some other phones and e-readers use resistive or infrared touch screens, which only require pressure to register contact. You can use just about anything as a makeshift stylus--just be careful not to scratch the screen.', ""2. Test your screen if you're not sure. Touch the screen with the tip of a pen cap. If the device responds, it is has a resistive or infrared touch screen. If nothing happens, the screen is inactive."", '1. Gather your materials. Find a clean dish sponge (not a scour pad) and a ballpoint pen with a removable tip.\nA cheap, plastic pen works best, as long as you can easily pull off the plastic tip and remove the ink.\nA slightly see-through pen can make it easier for you to see what you are doing.', '2. Cut off a piece of the sponge about the width of the pen. You can approximate this measurement by holding the pen against the sponge and marking the measurement with a marker, or you can just eyeball it.', '3. If the sponge has an abrasive side for scouring (like a Scotch-Brite sponge), cut or tear it off. Anything abrasive can scratch and damage your screen. You only want the actual sponge part.', '4. Wash and dry the sponge. Some sponges come with soap already added, so to be safe rinse the sponge in warm water. Squeeze out all of the water and let the sponge dry.', '5. Remove the plastic tip and the interior of the pen--the ballpoint tip, the ink reservoir, and spring if it is a click pen. You should be left with the empty base of the pen.\nYou should be able to pull the tip off with just your hand. If you have difficulty, try using a pair of needle-nose pliers.', '6. Insert the sponge into the pen. Pinch the sponge to make it smaller and push it into the base of the', '7. Leave about 1/4-1/8 of an inch of the sponge sticking out of the pen. Use your finger to feather and break up the fibers of the sponge.', ""8. Hold your stylus near the tip for it to work. Your fingers need to be touching the base of the pen that is in contact with the sponge. If you hold the hollow part of the pen, the electromagnetic current won't pass through the sponge and the touch screen won't register the touch of the stylus."", ""1. Gather your materials. You'll need about a foot of aluminum foil, tape of any kind, and an unsharpened pencil. You may also need a sharp knife to whittle your pencil.\nIf you don't have a pencil, you can substitute a pen, a chopstick, a dowel--anything pen-shaped. Pencils or other wooden objects work best, however, as you may want to cut your stylus to have an angled tip."", '2. Use a sharp knife to whittle tip of the pencil to a slight, flat angle. You are not sharpening the pencil tip as though you are going to write with it. The angled tip should still have a surface area of at least four millimeters, about the size of a pencil eraser or the very tip of your finger. Many capacitive touch screens will not register the touch of anything smaller.\nThe stylus will work without this step, but you will have to hold it straight up and down. This will make it more comfortable to hold.\nAlways be careful when handling a knife--remember to cut away from your body. Never pull the knife toward yourself.', '3. Wrap the entire pencil with at least two layers of aluminum foil. Fold the aluminum foil neatly over the tips.\nIf you are using a pen, keep the cap on the pen when you wrap it.', ""4. Smooth the aluminum foil over the angled tip of your pencil. It should be smooth and flat on the tip. You don't want any crinkles or bumps.\nIf your tip is not flat, your stylus may not work."", '5. Wrap a piece of tape around the center of the pencil. This will keep the foil in place.', '6. Wrap the tip of the stylus with scotch tape. This will protect you screen from getting scratched by the aluminum foil.', ""7. Try your stylus to see if it works. If it isn't working, try to flatten your tip even more. Remember that you want the tip to be at least the size of an eraser or else it may not be acknowledged by your touch screen."", ""1. Gather your materials. You'll need a single chopstick, sandpaper, and something to sharpen the wood. A hand-operated pencil sharpener is the easiest way, but you could also whittle the tip with a sharp knife if you don't have a pencil sharpener.\nTry not to use an electric pencil sharpener--it may break."", '2. Sharpen the tip (the narrow tip that touches the food) of the chopstick with the pencil sharpener. Sharpen it less than you would a pencil--you want it to look more like a blunt pencil tip.', ""3. Smooth the tip using the sandpaper. A sharp tip may damage your touch screen (or you). Rub the tip with the sandpaper until it is blunt. It should not be painful if you press it into your skin.\nSand any rough edges of the chopstick as well so you don't get splinters."", '4. Decorate your stylus with Washi tape or paint. A few layers of tape wrapped around the stylus may make it more comfortable to hold.\nRemember: this stylus will not work on an iPhone, Android, Kindle Fire, or other device with a capacitive screen.', '1. stuff you need. What you need is pretty simple. You need a pencil that can be sharpened or not. A Q-tip, tape, scissors and water and tin foil', '2. the pencil. With the pencil and scissors and Q-tip you want to cut the Q-tip in half. Then get the tape and tape the Q-tip on the side or on top of the sharper dull part of pencil. Place it facing where you write with. Then tape it.', '3. wraping. With the tin foil you want to cut in a triangle. Then after you cut the tin foil into a triangle you want to wrap it around the Q-tip and pencil. Then place a long piece of tap around starting where you ended from the tin foil around the pencil.', '4. Water. Now go to the sink with your stylus and get one  or two drips of water on top of it. Now you can use it and try it out. If there is to much water its not going to work. So only drip a few.']"
Hobbies and Crafts,"['1. Draw a hopscotch design on the ground. Chalk is the best drawing medium on asphalt, patio stones or concrete. The squares should be large enough to fit one foot and to make sure that a stone thrown into the square will not bounce out too easily. While there are variants on drawing the design, a common schoolyard design is shown here.\nIt is common to designate the ""10"" section shown here as a rest or stop area. This is where the player can take a moment to turn around and/or regain their balance. Sometimes a more creative name, like ""Heaven"" is given to the space.', ""2. Throw a flat stone or similar object (small beanbag, shell, button, plastic toy) to land on square one. It has to land inside the square without touching the border or bouncing out. If you don't get it within the lines, you lose your turn and pass the stone to the next person. If you do get it, however, go on to the next step.\nHopscotch can be played with just one person. If that's your case, make up the rules as you see fit!"", ""3. Hop through the squares, skipping the one you have your marker on. Each square gets one foot. Which foot you start with is up to you. You can't have more than one foot on the ground at a time, unless there are two number squares right next to each other. In that case, you can put down both feet simultaneously (one in each square). Always keep your feet inside the appropriate square(s); if you step on a line, hop on the wrong square, or step out of the square, you lose your turn."", ""4. Pick up the marker on your way back. When you get to the last number, turn around (remaining on one foot) and hop your way back in reverse order. While you're on the square right before the one with your marker, lean down (probably on one foot still!) and pick it up. Then, skip over that square and finish up."", '5. Pass the marker on to the next person. If you completed the course with your marker on square one (and without losing your turn), then throw your marker onto square two on your next turn. Your goal is to complete the course with the marker on each square. The first person to do this wins the game!\nAshrita Furman holds the Guinness World Record for completing the fastest game of hopscotch, coming in at 68 seconds. In case you were curious.', '1. Change the shape of the hopscotch course. Make it circular, with the numbers going in a spiral direction. Maybe that\'s why the French call it ""escargot?"" Or make it a rectangle, triangle, or firework!\nIt\'s easiest to start from the middle and go outward. That way you can make it as big as you need -- instead of ending up with your last square being microscopic!', '2. Vary the size and shape of the squares. Make some of them smaller so that people have to step on their tip toes. You can even make some in the shape of a shoe to control the direction in which the person faces. Get creative!', ""3. Make some squares into islands. That way, a person needs to jump over a distance to get to it. Just make sure the spaces are jump-able! And who said hopscotch didn't require skill?"", '4. Set a time limit. Make into a game of ""speed hopscotch."" The person has a certain amount of time to complete the course, or else they lose their turn. Or you could turn it into a race!']"
Food and Entertaining,"[""1. Smell the pineapple. Flip the pineapple over and sniff the stem end. A sweet scent is generally considered the most important aspect of choosing a ripe pineapple. If it has no scent, it's probably not ripe.\nYou can try smelling the pineapple from other sides; a sweet enough scent may be distinguishable from any side of the fruit. You should still be able to smell the scent from the stem end, however, where it will likely be strongest.\nAvoid pineapples that smell fermented. Although you want the pineapple to smell sweet, you do not want it to be so ripe that the sweet smell has an alcoholic or vinegar-like taint to it."", '2. Squeeze the pineapple. Lightly squeeze the pineapple using the fingers of one hand. You want the pineapple to be pretty firm, but soft enough that it gives very slightly when you press down on it.', '3. Determine whether or not the pineapple is heavy. A heavier pineapple means a juicier pineapple, because the extra juice gives the pineapple extra weight. More juice also means a riper, sweeter pineapple.\nNote that ""heavier"" doesn\'t mean ""larger."" The pineapple should feel heavy when compared to others of equal size. If a larger pineapple feels just as heavy as a slightly smaller one, the smaller one is probably a better pick.', '4. Pluck a leaf from the top of the pineapple. While public opinion is conflicted over the efficacy of this method, some people believe that a pineapple is ripe when a leaf can be plucked from the top of the pineapple without too much resistance. If a leaf comes out too easily, however, the pineapple may be rotten.', '1. Be alert for the two key elements of a ripe pineapple: freshness and deterioration. You are looking for a fresh pineapple, not a rotting one. The stem is the area of the pineapple that feeds sugar to the fruit. It is from here that the pineapple changes color.', ""2. Look at the pineapple's color. It will often reflect a golden-yellow color, but a green-tinted pineapple is not necessarily unripe.\nBe aware that some pineapples are considered to be ripe when still partially green, but the pineapple should not be all green or all brown. You should also place more emphasis on the pineapple's healthy appearance.\nAs a general rule, the yellow coloration should be visible on the eyes at the base of the fruit. Color that rises further up the pineapple usually indicates a sweeter fruit."", '3. Focus on the color of the leaves. Because the color of the fruit itself can be either golden-yellow or green, looking at the leaf color might be a better option. Choose pineapples with healthy, green leaves.', '4. Check out the shape of the pineapple. Pineapples should be well developed with rounded edges and developed eyes. The eyes are the spiked centers of the rough circles created by the geometric pattern on the pineapple. Make sure that the eyes have filled out and are relatively flat.\nAvoid pineapples with wrinkled skin, reddish-brown skin, cracks or leaks, mold, or brown withering leaves, as these are all signs of a rotten fruit.', '5. Choose pineapples from the growing location closest to you. For instance, if you live in California, Hawaiian or Mexican pineapples will probably be the freshest because they traveled the shortest distance from the plantation to your supermarket.', '1. Eat a whole pineapple stored at room temperature within a few days. As long as you do not cut the pineapple, it should stay fresh for several days. Do not leave cut pineapple out in a room temperature setting, however, since it will spoil after a few hours.', '2. Refrigerate your pineapple to keep it fresh longer. A whole refrigerated pineapple, when left uncut, can last about two weeks. Once you cut the pineapple or remove its skin, it will only last for about one week in your refrigerator.', '3. Cut the pineapple up and refrigerate it for up to one week. To properly cut your pineapple, cut off the crown and the base of the fruit. Place the pineapple upright on a cutting board and carefully slice on the inside of the rind from top to bottom. Make sure to cut deep enough to remove all of the prickly rind.\nThe pineapple will still have its ""eyes"" at this point. You can cut them away individually, but it might be easier to cut along the sides of the pineapple in a diagonal, v-shaped trench since the eyes should be patterned along the sides in a diagonal.{""smallUrl"":""https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/23\\/Tell-if-a-Pineapple-Is-Ripe-Step-11.jpg\\/v4-459px-Tell-if-a-Pineapple-Is-Ripe-Step-11.jpg"",""bigUrl"":""\\/images\\/thumb\\/2\\/23\\/Tell-if-a-Pineapple-Is-Ripe-Step-11.jpg\\/aid135618-v4-728px-Tell-if-a-Pineapple-Is-Ripe-Step-11.jpg"",""smallWidth"":460,""smallHeight"":306,""bigWidth"":""728"",""bigHeight"":""485"",""licensing"":""<div class=\\""mw-parser-output\\""><p>License: <a rel=\\""nofollow\\"" class=\\""external text\\"" href=\\""https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\"">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>""}\n\nCut the pineapple in half lengthwise and then in half again so that you have four triangle-shaped quarters.{""smallUrl"":""https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c5\\/Tell-if-a-Pineapple-Is-Ripe-Step-13Bullet1.jpg\\/v4-459px-Tell-if-a-Pineapple-Is-Ripe-Step-13Bullet1.jpg"",""bigUrl"":""\\/images\\/thumb\\/c\\/c5\\/Tell-if-a-Pineapple-Is-Ripe-Step-13Bullet1.jpg\\/aid135618-v4-728px-Tell-if-a-Pineapple-Is-Ripe-Step-13Bullet1.jpg"",""smallWidth"":460,""smallHeight"":306,""bigWidth"":""728"",""bigHeight"":""485"",""licensing"":""<div class=\\""mw-parser-output\\""><p>License: <a rel=\\""nofollow\\"" class=\\""external text\\"" href=\\""https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\"">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>""}\n\nCut the tough core out of the center and discard, then slice the four pieces into chunks or slices.{""smallUrl"":""https:\\/\\/www.wikihow.com\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/59\\/Tell-if-a-Pineapple-Is-Ripe-Step-13Bullet2.jpg\\/v4-459px-Tell-if-a-Pineapple-Is-Ripe-Step-13Bullet2.jpg"",""bigUrl"":""\\/images\\/thumb\\/5\\/59\\/Tell-if-a-Pineapple-Is-Ripe-Step-13Bullet2.jpg\\/aid135618-v4-728px-Tell-if-a-Pineapple-Is-Ripe-Step-13Bullet2.jpg"",""smallWidth"":460,""smallHeight"":306,""bigWidth"":""728"",""bigHeight"":""485"",""licensing"":""<div class=\\""mw-parser-output\\""><p>License: <a rel=\\""nofollow\\"" class=\\""external text\\"" href=\\""https:\\/\\/creativecommons.org\\/licenses\\/by-nc-sa\\/3.0\\/\\"">Creative Commons<\\/a><br>\\n<\\/p><p><br \\/>\\n<\\/p><\\/div>""}', ""4.

Education and Communications,"['1. Do writing exercises. A poem might start as a snippet of a verse, a line or two that seems to come out of nowhere, or an image you cannot get out of your head. You can find inspiration for your poem by doing writing exercises and using the world around you. Once you have inspiration, you can then shape and mold your thoughts into a poem.Brainstorming for IdeasTry a free write. Grab a notebook or your computer and just start writing—about your day, your feelings, or how you don’t know what to write about. Let your mind wander for 5-10 minutes and see what you can come up with.Write to a prompt. Look up poem prompts online or come up with your own, like “what water feels like” or “how it feels to get bad news.” Write down whatever comes to mind and see where it takes you.Make a list or mind map of images. Think about a situation that’s full of emotion for you and write down a list of images or ideas that you associate with it. You could also write about something you see right in front of you, or take a walk and note down things you see.', '2. Get inspired by your environment and those close to you. Inspiration for a great poem is all around you, even if you don’t see it just yet. Think of every memory, situation, and moment as a possible topic and you’ll start seeing poetry all around you!Finding a TopicGo for a walk. Head to your favorite park or spot in the city, or just take a walk through your neighborhood. Use the people you see and the nature and buildings you pass as inspiration for a poem.Write about someone you care about. Think about someone who’s really important to you, like a parent or your best friend. Recall a special moment you shared with them and use it to form a poem that shows that you care about them.Pick a memory you have strong feelings about. Close your eyes, clear your head, and see what memories come to the forefront of your mind. Pay attention to what emotions they bring up for you—positive or negative—and probe into those. Strong emotional moments make for beautiful, interesting poems.', '3. Pick a specific theme or idea. You can start your poem by focusing on a specific theme or idea that you find fascinating or interesting. Picking a specific theme or idea to focus on in the poem can give your poem a clear goal or objective. This can make it easier for you to narrow down what images and descriptions you are going to use in your poem.\n\nFor example, you may decide to write a poem around the theme of “love and friendship.” You may then think about specific moments in your life where you experienced love and friendship as well as how you would characterize love and friendship based on your relationships with others.\nTry to be specific when you choose a theme or idea, as this can help your poem feel less vague or unclear. For example, rather than choose the general theme of “loss,” you may choose the more specific theme, such as “loss of a child” or “loss of a best friend.”', '4. Choose a poetic form. Get your creative juices flowing by picking a form for your poem. There are many different poetic forms that you can use, from free verse to sonnet to rhyming couplet. You may go for a poetic form that you find easy to use, such as free verse, or a form that you find more challenging, such as a sonnet. Choose one poetic form and stick to that structure so your poem feels cohesive to your reader.\nYou may decide to try a poetic form that is short, such as the haiku, the cinquain, or the shape poem. You could then play around with the poetic form and have fun with the challenges of a particular form.\nYou may opt for a form that is more funny and playful, such as the limerick form, if you are trying to write a funny poem. Or you may go for a more lyrical form like the sonnet, the ballad, or the rhyming couplet for a poem that is more dramatic and romantic.', '5. Read examples of poetry. To get a better sense of what other poets are writing, you may look through examples of poetry. You may read poems written in the same poetic form you are interested in or poems about themes or ideas that you find inspiring. You may also choose poems that are well known and considered “classics” to get a better sense of the genre. For example, you may read:\n“Kubla Khan” by Samuel Taylor Coleridge\n“Song of Myself” by Walt Whitman\n“I measure every Grief I meet” by Emily Dickinson\n“Sonnet 18” by William Shakespeare\n“One Art” by Elizabeth Bishop\n“Night Funeral in Harlem” by Langston Hughes\n“The Red Wheelbarrow” by William Carlos Williams', '1. Use concrete imagery. Avoid abstract imagery and go for concrete descriptions of people, places, and things in your poem. You should always try to describe something using the five senses: smell, taste, touch, sight, and sound. Using concrete imagery will immerse your reader in the world of your poem and make images come alive for them.\nFor example, rather than try to describe a feeling or image with abstract words, use concrete words instead. Rather than write, “I felt happy,” you may use concrete words to create a concrete image, such as, “My smile lit up the room like wildfire.”', '2. Include literary devices. Literary devices like metaphor and simile add variety and depth to your poetry. Using these devices can make your poem stand out to your reader and allow you to paint a detailed picture for your reader. Try to use literary devices throughout your poem, varying them so you do not use only metaphors or only similes in your writing.Try a New Literary DeviceMetaphor: This device compares one thing to another in a surprising way. A metaphor is a great way to add unique imagery and create an interesting tone. Example: “I was a bird on a wire, trying not to look down.”Simile: Similes compare two things using “like” or “as.” They might seem interchangeable with metaphors, but both create a different flow and rhythm you can play with. Example: “She was as alone as a crow in a field,” or “My heart is like an empty stage.”Personification: If you personify an object or idea, you’re describing it by using human qualities or attributes. This can clear up abstract ideas or images that are hard to visualize. Example: “The wind breathed in the night.”Alliteration: Alliteration occurs when you use words in quick succession that begin with the same letter. This is a great tool if you want to play with the way your poem sounds. Example: “Lucy let her luck linger.”', '3. Write for the ear. Poetry is made to be read out loud and you should write your poem with a focus on how it sounds on the page. Writing for the ear will allow you to play with the structure of your poem and your word choice. Notice how each line of your poem flows into one another and how placing one word next to another creates a certain sound\n\nFor example, you may notice how the word “glow” sounds compared to the word “glitter.” “Glow” has an “ow” sound, which conjures an image of warmth and softness to the listener. The word “glitter” is two syllables and has a more pronounced “tt” sound. This word creates a sharper, more rhythmic sound for the listener.', '4. Avoid cliche. Your poetry will be much stronger if you avoid cliches, which are phrases that have become so familiar they have lost their meaning. Go for creative descriptions and images in your poem so your reader is surprised and intrigued by your writing. If you feel a certain phrase or image will be too familiar to your reader, replace it with a more unique phrase.\nFor example, you may notice you have used the cliche, “she was as busy as a bee” to describe a person in your poem. You may replace this cliche with a more unique phrase, such as “her hands were always occupied” or “she moved through the kitchen at a frantic pace.”', '1. Read the poem out loud. Once you have completed a draft of the poem, you should read it aloud to yourself. Notice how the words sound on the page. Pay attention to how each line of your poem flows into the next. Keep a pen close by so you can mark any lines or words that sound awkward or jumbled.\n\nYou may also read the poem out loud to others, such as friends, family, or a partner. Have them respond to the poem on the initial listen and notice if they seem confused or unclear about certain phrases or lines.', '2. Get feedback from others. You can also share your poem with other poets to get feedback from them and improve your poem. You may join a poetry writing group, where you workshop your poems with other poets and work on your poetry together. Or you may take a poetry writing class where you work with an instructor and other aspiring poets to improve your writing. You can then take the feedback you receive from your peers and use it in your revision of the poem.', '3. Revise your poem. Once you have received feedback on your poem, you should revise it until it is at its best. Use feedback from others to cut out any lines to feel confusing or unclear. Be willing to “kill your darlings” and not hold onto pretty lines just for the sake of including them in the poem. Make sure every line of the poem contributes to the overall goal, theme, or idea of the poem.\n\nYou may go over the poem with a fine tooth comb and remove any cliches or familiar phrases. You should also make sure spelling and grammar in the poem is correct.']"
Health,"['1. Obtain your ingredients. The components needed to make gel alcohol hand sanitizer are common household products, so it’s quite possible that you already have them. If you don’t, you can obtain them easily at any drug or grocery store. You will need rubbing (isopropyl) alcohol that is at a minimum 91% pure and plain aloe vera gel. That’s it!\nTo be comparable to store-bought products like Purell or Germ-X in terms of effectiveness, the final product needs to be at least 65% alcohol. Using 91% isopropyl alcohol will place your final product within that range.\nIf you can find 99% isopropyl alcohol, choose that. It’s not required, but it will increase the germ-killing effectiveness of your final product.\nAloe vera gel also comes in a variety of purity options. You’ll want the purest that you can find – simply check out the label to get the purity information. This doesn’t alter the effectiveness of the product, but using the purest you can find will ensure that your final mixture contains the least amount of additives and additional chemicals.', '2. Gather your tools. The tools needed are also very common household items, which makes this process even easier! You’ll need a clean bowl, a spatula (or spoon), a funnel, and a recycled liquid soap or hand sanitizer bottle. If you don’t have an empty bottle on hand to upcycle, you can use any kind of container you want, as long as it has a lid.', '3. Combine the ingredients. Measure out ⁄4 cup (180 ml) of isopropyl alcohol and ⁄4 cup (59 ml) of plain aloe vera gel and dump both of them together into the bowl. Use your spatula (or spoon) to stir vigorously until the ingredients are fully mixed together.\nIf you’d prefer not to mix by hand in a bowl, you can use your food processor instead.\nIf the ingredients flow too easily, add in ⁄8 cup (30 ml) more aloe gel and stir it together. Be careful adding any more gel since you may dilute the alcohol so much that it won’t be effective against bacteria.', ""4. Bottle your product. Use the funnel to pour the mixture directly from the bowl into the bottle you’ve chosen to use. Replace the pump, lid, or cap on your bottle. Now you have your finished product and it's ready to use immediately!\nThe mixture will keep for 6 months or more. Store it away from direct sunlight to get the longest shelf life possible.\nPut the mixture in smaller bottles that can easily fit into a purse, backpack, or briefcase for use on the go. If you purchase any commercial sanitizers, save the bottles so that you can upcycle them later, since those are perfect for this.\nYou can usually purchase new empty bottles of this size at the grocery store. Check the aisle with travel-size personal care items.\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJonathan Tavarez\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Founder, Pro Housekeepers\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJonathan Tavarez is the Founder of Pro Housekeepers, a premium cleaning service headquartered in Tampa, Florida catering to residential and commercial clients across the United States.

There is actually a proper way to use sanitizer to get maximum effectiveness from the product. Before you start, make sure your hands are clean of visible dirt and grime. Sanitizer isn't meant for situations when you find your hands dirty with actual dirt.\nUsing about a palm-sized amount of the sanitizer, rub your hands briskly together for 20 to 30 seconds, taking care to get underneath your fingernails, between your fingers, the back of your hands and your wrists.\nAllow the sanitizer to dry completely, without wiping your hands off or rinsing them with water.\nOnce the sanitizer dries completely, the process is complete.\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJonathan Tavarez\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCleaning Guru & Founder, Pro Housekeepers\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tJonathan Tavarez is the Founder of Pro Housekeepers, a premium cleaning service headquartered in Tampa, Florida catering to residential and commercial clients across the United States.

Then, rub your hands together until they're completely dry. However, you should only use sanitizer if you're unable to wash your hands, and refrain from using it if your hands are greasy or visibly dirty."", '1. Determine your goal(s) for adding essential oils. Essential oils can be added to your sanitizer for the fragrance alone, but the benefits of essential oils extend well beyond simply providing a pleasant scent. The oils have been used for thousands of years by cultures all over the world to provide healing effects for mental, physical, and emotional ailments.\nInhalation of the different scents offers a wide range of psychological and physical benefits known as aromatherapy.\nEssential oils can also be used medicinally by way of both scent and physical application to provide additional health, hygiene, and beauty advantages.\nThe use of essential oils in your hand sanitizer will not only deliver a terrific smell, but they can also address specific physical and mental health issues.', '2. Choose essential oils for aromatherapy. Inhaling the scent of a particular essential oil can stimulate your brain to trigger a variety of mental and emotional reactions. By adding them to your hand sanitizer, you can have a therapeutic experience while also killing pesky germs. You can choose one oil or combine oils to create multi-layered effects. The world of aromatherapy is far too vast for a detailed examination here, but some specific essential oils are most commonly employed for use in hand sanitizers.\nCinnamon essential oil has fragrance properties that can reduce drowsiness and enhance concentration.\nLavender essential oil is a rejuvenating scent that can induce relaxation and feelings of calmness.\nRosemary essential oil has properties known to boost information retention, alertness, and memory.\nLemon essential oil has an uplifting scent that can help ease depression and sadness while also boosting energy.\nPeppermint essential oil is an invigorating scent that can soothe frazzled nerves and improve mental clarity.', '3. Choose essential oils for medicinal purposes. Essential oils have naturally occurring chemicals in them that can provide medicinal and curative benefits when inhaled into the lungs or applied to the skin. Several essential oils are known to have powerful antibacterial, antifungal and/or antiviral properties. These qualities make the oils ideal for use in hand sanitizer because they will boost the effectiveness of the product with natural ingredients.\nCinnamon essential oil is known to be a potent antiseptic and its fragrance can also decrease headache pain.\nLavender essential oil can relieve pain associated with headaches and migraines and can be applied topically to relieve minor skin irritations.\nTea Tree essential oil is known to have powerful antiseptic and antibacterial properties when applied topically.\nEucalyptus essential oil has antibacterial properties and can help relieve achy muscles. Inhaling it can clear sinuses and boost the immune system.', '4. Use caution. Essential oils are highly concentrated and can have negative side effects if used improperly. Pregnant women and those with immune deficiencies shouldn’t use them without consulting a doctor first. If you’re new to the world of essential oils, do a skin patch test before adding it to your hand sanitizer and using it topically.\nNever apply an essential oil directly to the skin without diluting it first. Because they are so concentrated, some of them can be skin irritants.\nWhen working with essential oils, use the highest grade products that you can find. Check the label for terms like “pure grade”, “aromatherapy grade”, “certified organic” and “therapeutic grade” when purchasing.', '5. Add your chosen oils to your sanitizer. Measure out 2/3 cup of isopropyl alcohol and 1/3 cup of plain aloe vera gel and dump both of them together into the bowl. Add ten drops of your chosen essential oil(s). Do not exceed 10 drops! Use your spatula (or spoon) to stir vigorously until all of the ingredients are fully mixed together.', ""1. Obtain your ingredients. Most of the components needed to make the hand sanitizer are common household products, so it’s quite possible that you already have most of them. Start with a bottle of 190-proof grain alcohol, such as Everclear, which is 95% alcohol. Since your hand sanitizer needs to be at least 65% alcohol to be effective, using a high-proof liquor will ensure you get the strength you need. In addition, you'll need plain aloe vera gel, and any essential oils you'd like to use.\nAlways double-check the alcohol content before you buy a bottle of grain alcohol since many commercial brands are less than 190-proof.\nRemember you may dilute the strength of the alcohol with other ingredients, so it will not maintain 95% alcohol content.\nThe essential oils you choose are completely up to you. Lavender, lemon, peppermint, geranium, cinnamon, tea tree, and rosemary are common choices. You can use more than one if you like, but the total amount of essential oil you use should not exceed 10 drops.\nAloe vera gel also comes in a variety of purity options. You’ll want the purest that you can find – simply check out the label to get the purity information."", '2. Gather your tools. You’ll need a clean bowl, a spatula (or spoon), a funnel and a recycled liquid soap or hand sanitizer bottle. If you don’t have an empty bottle on hand to upcycle, you can use any kind of container you want, as long as it has a lid.', ""3. Combine the ingredients. Measure out 2  fl oz (59 ml) of grain alcohol and 1  fl oz (30 ml) of plain aloe vera gel and dump both of them together in the bowl. Add ten drops of your chosen essential oil(s). Use your spatula (or spoon) to stir vigorously until the ingredients are fully mixed together.\nYou can adjust the amount of the products that you're using if you'd like, but keep the grain alcohol at a 2-to-1 ratio with the gel to ensure it's strong enough.\nIf you’d prefer not to mix by hand in a bowl, you can use your food processor instead."", '4. Bottle your product. Use the funnel to pour the mixture directly from the bowl into the bottle you’ve chosen to use. Replace the pump, lid, or cap on your bottle. Now you have your finished product and its ready-to-use immediately!\nUse the mixture within one month. Store it out of direct sunlight.']"
Computers and Electronics,"[""1. Learn a programming language. You shouldn't limit yourself to any particular language, but there are a few guidelines. Learning a programming language might take time, so you need to be patient.\nC and C++ are the languages that Linux and Windows were built with. It (along with assembly language) teaches something that's very important in hacking: how memory works.\nPython or Ruby are high-level, powerful scripting languages that can be used to automate various tasks.\nBase 64 is also a good choice. It is a language that turns letters, number, and, symbols into different letters, numbers, and, symbols.\nPerl is a reasonable choice in this field as well, while PHP is worth learning because the majority of web applications use PHP.\nBash scripting is a must. That is how to easily manipulate Unix/Linux systems—writing scripts, which will do most of the job for you.\nAssembly language is a must-know. It is the basic language that your processor understands, and there are multiple variations of it. You can't truly exploit a program if you don't know assembly."", ""2. Know your target. The process of gathering information about your target is known as enumeration. The more you know in advance, the fewer surprises you'll have."", '1. Use a *nix terminal for commands. Cygwin will help emulate a *nix for Windows users. Nmap in particular uses WinPCap to run on Windows and does not require Cygwin. However, Nmap works poorly on Windows systems due to a lack of raw sockets. You should also consider using Linux or BSD, which are both more flexible. Most Linux distributions come with many useful tools pre-installed.\nAlternatively, on Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and later, find a *nix terminal in the Windows Store, Windows can emulate Linux command-lines thanks to Windows Linux Subsystem.', ""2. Secure your machine first. Make sure you've fully understood all common techniques to protect yourself. Start with the basics — but make sure you have authorization to attack your target: either attack your own network, ask for written permission, or set up your own laboratory with virtual machines. Attacking a system, no matter its content, is illegal and WILL get you in trouble."", '3. Test the target. Can you reach the remote system? While you can use the ping utility (which is included in most operating systems) to see if the target is active, you can not always trust the results — it relies on the ICMP protocol, which can be easily shut off by paranoid system administrators.', '4. Determine the operating system (OS). Run a scan of the ports, and try pOf, or nmap to run a port scan. This will show you the ports that are open on the machine, the OS, and can even tell you what type of firewall or router they are using so you can plan a course of action. You can activate OS detection in nmap by using the -O switch.', '5. Find a path or open port in the system. Common ports such as FTP (21) and HTTP (80) are often well protected, and possibly only vulnerable to exploits yet to be discovered.\nTry other TCP and UDP ports that may have been forgotten, such as Telnet and various UDP ports left open for LAN gaming.\nAn open port 22 is usually evidence of an SSH (secure shell) service running on the target, which can sometimes be brute forced.', ""6. Crack the password or authentication process. There are several methods for cracking a password, including brute force. Using brute force on a password is an effort to try every possible password contained within a pre-defined dictionary of brute force software\nUsers are often discouraged from using weak passwords, so brute force may take a lot of time. However, there have been major improvements in brute-force techniques.\nMost hashing algorithms are weak, and you can significantly improve the cracking speed by exploiting these weaknesses (like you can cut the MD5 algorithm in 1/4, which will give huge speed boost).\nNewer techniques use the graphics card as another processor — and it's thousands of times faster.\nYou may try using Rainbow Tables for the fastest password cracking. Notice that password cracking is a good technique only if you already have the hash of password.\nTrying every possible password while logging to remote machine is not a good idea, as it's easily detected by intrusion detection systems, pollutes system logs, and may take years to complete.\nYou can also get a rooted tablet, install a TCP scan, and get a signal to upload it to the secure site. Then the IP address will open causing the password to appear on your proxy.\nIt's often much easier to find another way into a system than cracking the password."", '7. Get super-user privileges. Try to get root privileges if targeting a *nix machine, or administrator privileges if taking on Windows systems.\nMost information that will be of vital interest is protected and you need a certain level of authentication to get it. To see all the files on a computer you need super-user privileges - a user account that is given the same privileges as the ""root"" user in Linux and BSD operating systems.\nFor routers this is the ""admin"" account by default (unless it has been changed); for Windows, this is the Administrator account.\nGaining access to a connection doesn\'t mean you can access everything. Only a super-user, the administrator account, or the root account can do this.', ""8. Use various tricks. Often, to gain super-user status you have to use tactics such as creating a buffer overflow, which causes the memory to dump and that allows you to inject a code or perform a task at a higher level than you're normally authorized.\nIn Unix-like systems this will happen if the bugged software has setuid bit set, so the program will be executed as a different user (super-user for example).\nOnly by writing or finding an insecure program that you can execute on their machine will allow you to do this."", ""9. Create a backdoor. Once you have gained full control over a machine, it's a good idea to make sure you can come back again. This can be done by backdooring an important system service, such as the SSH server. However, your backdoor may be removed during the next system upgrade. A really experienced hacker would backdoor the compiler itself, so every compiled software would be a potential way to come back."", ""10. Cover your tracks. Don't let the administrator know that the system is compromised. Don't change the website (if any), and don't create more files than you really need. Do not create any additional users. Act as quickly as possible. If you patched a server like SSHD, make sure it has your secret password hard-coded. If someone tries to login with this password, the server should let them in, but shouldn't contain any crucial information.""]"
Education and Communications,"[""1. Write your paper first. Even though an abstract goes at the beginning of the work, it acts as a summary of your entire paper. Rather than introducing your topic, it will be an overview of everything you write about in your paper. Save writing your abstract for last, after you have already finished your paper.\nA thesis and an abstract are entirely different things. The thesis of a paper introduces the main idea or question, while the abstract works to review the entirety of the paper, including the methods and results.\nEven if you think that you know what your paper is going to be about, always save the abstract for last. You will be able to give a much more accurate summary if you do just that - summarize what you've already written."", '2. Review and understand any requirements for writing your abstract.  The paper you’re writing probably has specific guidelines and requirements, whether it’s for publication in a journal, submission in a class, or part of a work project. Before you start writing, refer to the rubric or guidelines you were presented with to identify important issues to keep in mind.\nIs there a maximum or minimum length?\nAre there style requirements?\nAre you writing for an instructor or a publication?', '3. Consider your audience. Abstracts are written to help readers find your work. For example, in scientific journals, abstracts allow readers to quickly decide whether the research discussed is relevant to their own interests. Abstracts also help your readers get at your main argument quickly. Keep the needs of your readers in mind as you write the abstract.\nWill other academics in your field read this abstract?\nShould it be accessible to a lay reader or somebody from another field?', '4. Determine the type of abstract you must write. Although all abstracts accomplish essentially the same goal, there are two primary styles of abstract: descriptive and informative. You may have been assigned a specific style, but if you weren’t, you will have to determine which is right for you. Typically, informative abstracts are used for much longer and technical research while descriptive abstracts are best for shorter papers.\nDescriptive abstracts explain the purpose, goal, and methods of your research but leave out the results section. These are typically only 100-200 words.\nInformative abstracts are like a condensed version of your paper, giving an overview of everything in your research including the results. These are much longer than descriptive abstracts, and can be anywhere from a single paragraph to a whole page long.\nThe basic information included in both styles of abstract is the same, with the main difference being that the results are only included in an informative abstract, and an informative abstract is much longer than a descriptive one.\nA critical abstract is not often used, but it may be required in some courses. A critical abstract accomplishes the same goals as the other types of abstract, but will also relate the study or work being discussed to the writer’s own research. It may critique the research design or methods.', ""1. Identify your purpose. You're writing about a correlation between lack of lunches in schools and poor grades. So what? Why does this matter? The reader wants to know why your research is important, and what the purpose of it is. Start off your descriptive abstract by considering the following questions:\nWhy did you decide to do this study or project?\nHow did you conduct your research?\nWhat did you find?\nWhy is this research and your findings important?\nWhy should someone read your entire essay?"", '2. Explain the problem at hand. Abstracts state the “problem” behind your work. Think of this as the specific issue that your research or project addresses. You can sometimes combine the problem with your motivation, but it is best to be clear and separate the two. \nWhat problem is your research trying to better understand or solve?\nWhat is the scope of your study - a general problem, or something specific?\nWhat is your main claim or argument?', '3. Explain your methods. Motivation - check. Problem - check. Methods? Now is the part where you give an overview of how you accomplished your study. If you did your own work, include a description of it here. If you reviewed the work of others, it can be briefly explained.\nDiscuss your own research including the variables and your approach.\nDescribe the evidence you have to support your claim\nGive an overview of your most important sources.', '4. Describe your results (informative abstract only). This is where you begin to differentiate your abstract between a descriptive and an informative abstract. In an informative abstract, you will be asked to provide the results of your study. What is it that you found? \nWhat answer did you reach from your research or study?\nWas your hypothesis or argument supported?\nWhat are the general findings?', '5. Give your conclusion. This should finish up your summary and give closure to your abstract. In it, address the meaning of your findings as well as the importance of your overall paper. This format of having a conclusion can be used in both descriptive and informative abstracts, but you will only address the following questions in an informative abstract.\nWhat are the implications of your work?\nAre your results general or very specific?', '1. Keep it in order. There are specific questions your abstract must provide answers for, but the answers must be kept in order as well. Ideally, it should mimic the overall format of your essay, with a general ‘introduction, ‘body,’ and ‘conclusion.’\nMany journals have specific style guides for abstracts. If you’ve been given a set of rules or guidelines, follow them to the letter.', '2. Provide helpful information. Unlike a topic paragraph, which may be intentionally vague, an abstract should provide a helpful explanation of your paper and your research. Word your abstract so that the reader knows exactly what you’re talking about, and isn’t left hanging with ambiguous references or phrases.\nAvoid using direct acronyms or abbreviations in the abstract, as these will need to be explained in order to make sense to the reader. That uses up precious writing room, and should generally be avoided.\nIf your topic is about something well-known enough, you can reference the names of people or places that your paper focuses on.\nDon’t include tables, figures, sources, or long quotations in your abstract. These take up too much room and usually aren’t what your readers want from an abstract anyway.', ""3. Write it from scratch. Your abstract is a summary, yes, but it should be written completely separate from your paper. Don't copy and paste direct quotes from yourself, and avoid simply paraphrasing your own sentences from elsewhere in your writing. Write your abstract using completely new vocabulary and phrases to keep it interesting and redundancy-free."", '4. Use key phrases and words. If your abstract is to be published in a journal, you want people to be able to find it easily. In order to do so, readers will search for certain queries on online databases in hopes that papers, like yours, will show up. Try to use 5-10 important words or phrases key to your research in your abstract.\nFor example, if you’re writing a paper on the cultural differences in perceptions of schizophrenia, be sure to use words like “schizophrenia,” “cross-cultural,” “culture-bound,” “mental illness,” and “societal acceptance.” These might be search terms people use when looking for a paper on your subject.', '5. Use real information. You want to draw people in with your abstract; it is the hook that will encourage them to continue reading your paper. However, do not reference ideas or studies that you don’t include in your paper in order to do this. Citing material that you don’t use in your work will mislead readers and ultimately lower your viewership.', '6. Avoid being too specific. An abstract is a summary, and as such should not refer to specific points of your research other than possibly names or locations. You should not need to explain or define any terms in your abstract, a reference is all that is needed. Avoid being too explicit in your summary and stick to a very broad overview of your work.\nMake sure to avoid jargon. This specialized vocabulary may not be understood by general readers in your area and can cause confusion.', '7. Be sure to do basic revisions. The abstract is a piece of writing that, like any other, should be revised before being completed. Check it over for grammatical and spelling errors and make sure it is formatted properly.', '8. Get feedback from someone. Having someone else read your abstract is a great way for you to know whether you’ve summarized your research well. Try to find someone who doesn’t know everything about your project. Ask him or her to read your abstract and then tell you what s/he understood from it. This will let you know whether you’ve adequately communicated your key points in a clear manner. \nConsulting with your professor, a colleague in your field, or a tutor or writing center consultant can be very helpful. If you have these resources available to you, use them!\nAsking for assistance can also let you know about any conventions in your field. For example, it is very common to use the passive voice (“experiments were performed”) in the sciences. However, in the humanities active voice is usually preferred.']"
Personal Care and Style,"[""1. Get your hair ready for layering. Start with clean, damp hair, since it's more difficult to control the length when you work with wet hair. Use a wide-toothed comb to comb all of the tangles from your hair, so that the layers you create will be neat."", '2. Gather your hair at the top of your head. Keep the ponytail at the apex of your head, the flat area towards the back of the top of your head where you can balance a comb. Bend over so your head is upside down, comb your hair forward, and use your hands to form a ponytail at the top of your head.  Fasten it there with a hair elastic, then turn your head right side up. Make sure your hair is smooth against your head; any lumps or tangled parts could result in messy layering.', ""3. Move the elastic down the ponytail. Use one hand to hold the ponytail and the other hand to slide the elastic down until it's a couple of inches from the end of the ponytail. If you want subtle layering, slide the elastic down so there is only an inch or so of hair remaining in the ponytail. For more drastic layers, leave a few inches of hair in the ponytail.\nTo prevent this from becoming a mullet, slide the elastic until a few pieces of hair slide out around the nape of your neck."", '4. Cut the end of the ponytail. Hold your hair at the elastic to keep it from coming loose. Use a sharp pair of haircutting scissors to cut your hair just above the elastic, then shake out your hair.\nIf your hair is quite thick, you may have to cut through the ponytail in more than one section. Just make sure you cut each section at the same length, just above the elastic.\nBe careful not to cut at an angle or let the scissors slip. Cut straight across for even layers.', ""5. Examine your layers. This method creates a few face-framing layers in the front with longer layers in the back. If you'd like to adjust the length of your layers, use the scissors to carefully cut individual locks of hair.\nMake sure that you go slow and cut with caution to reduce the chances of making a mistake or cutting off too much hair.\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtney Foster\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProfessional Hair Stylist\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtney Foster is a Licensed Cosmetologist, Certified Hair Loss Practitioner, and Cosmetology Educator based out of New York City.

Layers give your hair movement and volume. Your hairstyle holds longer and is more symmetrical around your head. With layers, there is more overall body, which can make your hair look thicker."", ""1. Get your hair ready for layering. It's better to layer short hair when it's evenly damp, so that you can cut the hair with greater precision. Wash and condition your hair as usual, then towel it dry in preparation for the haircut.\nLayering short hair is more difficult to do by yourself than layering long hair, since you're creating each layer individually. Keep in mind that this method will only work for pixie style cuts. Take a look at your hair and decide exactly where you want the layers to be and how short you want them before you begin.\nPlan to cut your hair in a well-lit bathroom with at least two mirrors, so you can check your progress often and see the back of your head as well."", '2. Comb your hair into sections. Short hair must be divided into sections before layering. Use a comb to carefully divide your hair in the following way:\nMake a ""top box"" section by creating a part on either side of the crown of the head where the head begins to round. The two parts create a section of hair in the middle of the head.\nComb this ""top box"" forward and comb the hair to either side straight down, so that the sections are clearly delineated. It may also help to twist your hair before clipping it.\nDivide the rest into two parts: the first part extends from the crown of your head to your forehead, and the second part extends from the crown of your head to the nape of your neck.', '3. Use a comb to lift the frontmost section of the top box. Lift the hair at a ninety-degree angle from your head and hold it straight between your forefinger and middle finger. Your fingers should be perpendicular to your forehead.', ""4. Trim the top box. Use a sharp scissors to trim the tips of the hair extending from between your fingers. Let the hair fall, then use the comb to lift another section of hair in the section of hair that is immediately behind the front section. Then comb a bit of the hair from the first section into this new section. This will serve as a guide for the correct length. Hold it at a 90-degree angle from your head between your forefinger and middle finger, then trim the tips to the exact same length as the first section of hair you trimmed.\nContinue trimming hair from the top until you've trimmed the entire front and back sections of the box.\nUse a spray bottle filled with water to keep the hair damp as you go. If your hair gets too wet, then dry it off with a towel.\nPay careful attention to which sections of hair have been cut and which still need to be cut. When you're working with short hair, cutting the same section twice can make a big difference.\nAll hair should be trimmed to the same length. When the cut is finished, it will be layered in appearance."", '5. Part your hair down the middle. Once the entire top box has been trimmed, change the part of your hair by combing it to the sides so that you have a part straight down the middle.', ""6. Trim the sides of your hair. Working from the front of your hair around the side to the back, lift sections of hair straight from the top of your head and hold them between your fingers. Hold your hair so that your fingers are perpendicular to your forehead. Use the scissors to trim the tips of your hair, then move on to the next section. Repeat until you've trimmed the top layer of hair on the side of your head, then do the other side."", '7. Examine your layers. If you see a spot that is uneven, or you want shorter layers, use the scissors to carefully trim your hair a small section at a time. At this point, you can also refine the edges. Comb your hair into the style you plan to wear it in and trim the edges. Check around the ears and the back of the hairline especially.']"
Home and Garden,"[""1. Determine which variety you're growing. Before you make any cuts, figure out whether you're growing an indeterminate or determinate variety of tomato plant. Indeterminate varieties grow like vines, and they must be trained upright on poles and pruned in order to grow correctly. Determinate varieties contain themselves before they grow into a bush, and they naturally direct their energy toward fruiting without needing as much intervention. Here are the common varieties of each:\n\nIndeterminate: Big Boy, Beef Master, Black Prince, German Queen, most cherry tomato varieties and most heirloom varieties.\n\nDeterminate:Ace 55, Amelia, Better Bush, Biltmore, Heatmaster, Heinz Classic, Mountain Pride and Patio."", '2. Check the plant for signs of yellowing. One way to know when it is time to start pruning is to wait for the stems and leaves below the first set of flowers to turn yellow. When you notice this color change, you can start pruning.', '3. Check for suckers. Look for the tiny new branches sprouting in the spot where a branch meets the stem on an indeterminate plant. These are called ""suckers"" and they\'re what you want to remove. Suckers left to grow will take energy from the rest of the plant and cause the plant to bear fewer fruits. This isn\'t always a bad thing, but strategically removing suckers will help your plant bear large fruit all season long.', '4. Look for flowers. It is a good idea to start pruning your tomato plants early, as soon as there are flowers on the plants. At this point, the plants should be between 12 and 18 inches.', '1. Remove all suckers and their leaves below the first flower cluster. Do this no matter what kind of tomato plant you have. This keeps the plant strong by helping it grow a sturdy central stem.  This should ensure that the majority of the nutrients are sent to the fruits, instead of being wasted on the unwanted growing tips.\nTo remove a sucker, grab a growing tip by the base between the thumb and forefinger and bend it back and forth until it snaps cleanly. This should ideally be done when the shoot is young and supple. The small wound will heal quickly. This is called ""simple pruning"".\nAs for stems and leaves, not the suckers, growing below the first flower cluster: If you live in a warmer zone such as Zone 9, you should leave them on until they turn yellow. They are important for helping to shade the ground until the plant matures. On the other hand, if your plant is in a humid environment (such as a greenhouse), remove everything below the first flower cluster to improve ventilation.  Humidity can make it easier for sicknesses to flourish, and it also causes the wounds that are created while pruning to dry up more slowly making the plant longer vulnerable. By improving ventilation, you\'re helping to protect the plant.', '2. Leave the thicker shoots. Thicker suckers should not be snapped off, since this could damage the whole plant. If it\'s thicker than a pencil, use the ""Missouri pruning"" method and pinch out just the tip of the sucker, leaving one or two leaves behind for photosynthesis and to protect developing fruit from sun scald. The drawback is that suckers will develop from the stem that you leave behind, which will require additional pruning. This technique is better when you\'re dealing with large suckers; if the wound becomes diseased, it will be further away from the main stem. This method also leaves a few inches on the sucker to reduce the shock to the plant.\nPrune suckers all summer long to keep the plant healthy. They grow quickly, so you may need to prune once or twice a week.', ""3. Pinch off all but four or five fruit bearing trusses for indeterminate varieties. These are the branches that grow from the main stem above the first flower cluster. Four or five will produce large, healthy fruit, but any more than that and the fruit will be small and scant. Choose four or five sturdy trusses to keep, then pinch out any additional side shoots, leaving the plant's top shoot intact, known as the terminal shoot.\nMake sure the vine-like plants are tied to supports after flowering occurs. Otherwise, the vine will grow along the ground and won't produce healthy tomatoes.\nDeterminate plants already have a predetermined number of stems that will naturally grow, so there's no need to do any pruning above the flower cluster. If you prune above the flower cluster, you'll be removing fruit-bearing branches without helping the plant."", '4. Remove yellow leaves. Yellow leaves are leaves that use up more sugar than they produce. As the plant begins to mature, the lower leaves will naturally begin to yellow and wilt. This is perfectly normal, so pull these from the plant when they appear. It will keep the plant fresh and help ward off disease.', '5. Top the plant.  To get the best out of the last growth of the season, it is necessary to ""top"" the plant. About a month before the first expected frost, or when the plant hits the roof of your greenhouse, remove the plant\'s terminal shoot. At this point in the season, the tomatoes currently growing will have a limited time to reach maturity, so all nutrients must be directed straight to the fruit.']"
Food and Entertaining,"['1. Check to see if it has turned a dull brown or grey. Fresh beef will be bright red in color, but it may have a few brown spots in the middle since ground beef is taken from different parts of the cow. Your ground beef will turn more grey the longer you keep it. If all of your beef is grey rather than red or brown, it’s best to throw it away.\nPrepackaged ground beef develops a brown color on the inside because oxygen is not able to reach the center.', '2. Smell the beef to see if you notice a sour smell. Fresh beef will have a slight smell, but beef starting to go bad will smell rotten or sour. The smell is produced from gases made by some of the bacteria on your beef. If there is a strong smell, avoid eating it.\nMany bacteria that cause food-borne illnesses like salmonella cannot be smelled and can be found on fresh beef. Always cook the beef thoroughly to kill bacteria. If you don’t feel comfortable eating the beef, throw it away.', '3. Touch the meat to see if it feels slimy. Squeeze the meat in your fingers to feel its consistency. Fresh meat should break apart in your hands easily and separate into chunks. If the meat is sticky or has a slimy texture, it has most likely gone bad.\nAlways wash your hands before and after you handle raw beef so you don’t spread bacteria or contaminate surfaces.', '4. Check the sell-by date on the packaging. Raw ground beef is safe to use only 1 or 2 days after the recommended sell-by date. Check the calendar to determine how many days have passed since you bought it and throw it away if it’s old.', '1. Store uncooked ground beef in the refrigerator at or below 40 °F (4 °C). If you plan to cook the beef soon, store it in your refrigerator. Beef left out at room temperature will start to harbor harmful bacteria colonies within 2 hours. Never leave meat out for longer than 2 hours at room temperature, or for more than 1 hour if it is above 90 °F (32 °C).\nIf you don’t plan to cook your beef right away, freeze it.', '2. Cook the beef within 2 days of the sell-by date. If the beef has been in a refrigerator the whole time, it will stay fresh and safe to use up to 2 days after the date listed on the packaging. Make sure you use the beef soon after you buy it so it doesn’t go to waste.', '3. Keep raw beef in the freezer for up to 4 months. Keep the beef in freezer-safe plastic bags and label them with the sell-by date listed on the packaging. Squeeze all the air out of the bag before sealing it to conserve freezer space.\nYou may start to notice white freezer spots on the beef after a few months. These areas can be cut off if there are only a few. Otherwise, throw the meat away.', '4. Thaw the beef in the fridge or in a sink filled with cold water. Transfer the frozen beef to the fridge 1 to 2 days before you plan to use it so it has time to completely thaw. If you want to thaw the meat in the sink, fill your sink with cold water and submerge the beef. Change the water every 30 minutes until it’s completely thawed.\nBeef thawed with water needs to be cooked right away.\nNever leave the meat to thaw at room temperature.\nBeef can be thawed in the microwave but it needs to be cooked right after it’s finished thawing to avoid any contamination.', '5. Cook ground beef to 160 °F (71 °C) before storing or eating it. The only way to kill the natural bacteria in your beef is to cook it entirely. Use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the meat while you’re cooking it.', '6. Store cooked ground beef in the refrigerator or freezer. Cooked ground beef can be safely stored in the fridge for 7 days before it starts to spoil. It can also be stored for up to 8 months in the freezer. Be sure to store it in an air-tight container!']"
Hobbies and Crafts,"['1. Lay newspapers on your floor in case of spills. Before you start bleaching, lay out newspapers around the area you plan to bleach. Many surfaces, especially carpeted floors, are prone to getting stained by bleach. Lay newspapers around your washing machine as well, as you will need to wash your jeans shortly after bleaching.', ""2. Change into clothes you don't mind staining. Wear older clothes, like sweats and a T-shirt, that you won't worry about staining with bleach. You could also wear an apron, if you would prefer.\nWear thick rubber gloves to avoid irritating your skin from the solution. You may also want to wear safety goggles to avoid getting bleach in your eyes."", ""3. Choose a well-ventilated area to avoid inhaling bleach fumes. Smelling bleach on its own usually doesn't induce negative health effects, but it can make some people anxious. If you feel faint, leave the area immediately and call poison control. Keep the product label nearby, if possible, to give information to poison control specialists.\nNever mix bleach with other household products. Some chemicals, when mixed with bleach, create toxic fumes. Avoid mixing bleach and ammonia, or ammonia and rubbing alcohol."", '4. Fill a bucket or bathtub with one part water and one part bleach. You can mix your bleach solution in a bucket, but using a bathtub makes it easy to turn on a fan and dispel fumes. Avoid a highly concentrated bleach solution. While you may get faster results, the solution will be corrosive and more likely to burn holes in the fabric.', ""5. Experiment first. If you've never bleached jeans before, have an old pair of jeans or a patch of jean material handy. Try your solution out on your ruined jeans before you apply it to your favorite jeans. You will get a better handle of how bleach lightens jeans and whether your concentration is too strong.\nDifferent jean colors may react in unique ways. Choose a ruined pair close to your favorite pair's color for the most accurate idea."", ""6. Use a bleach pen as an alternative. If using straight bleach makes you squeamish, you can also opt for a bleach pen (these are available at most stores). Bleach pens won't create a quite as natural look, but they involve less clean-up and are applied more easily. You can also use a bleach pen to draw intricate designs or words onto your jeans."", ""1. Dampen your jeans. Bleach will dye materials better if that material is already wet. Dampen your pair of jeans in cold water before you work on them. The jeans don't need to be soaking wet, so wring them out if they are dripping water."", ""2. Dab the bleach on with a sponge, paintbrush, or spray bottle. If you want to create patterns on your jeans, don't just put your jeans in the bleach solution. Instead, apply the bleach using one of several options.\nFor even, large areas, use a sponge to dab the bleach on.\nFor a splattered effect, use a paintbrush or toothbrush. Apply the bleach to the brush, then rub your thumb back across the bristles to achieve a splattered effect.\nIf you want to work quickly, fill a cheap spray bottle with the solution and apply it to areas you want lightened."", ""3. Work on one side at a time. Focus on the front or back first, then flip the jeans over to work on the back. If you don't want to bleach a certain side, stuff your pants with newspaper before you begin. The newspaper will prevent the bleach from soaking through to the other side."", ""4. Submerge your jeans fully into the solution for an even color. If you want to lighten your jeans entirely, soak your jeans in the bleach solution for 20-30 minutes Reposition the jeans and swirl the water every few minutes to avoid overexposing one area. Check for color changes every time you reposition, and remove the jeans when you've reached an ideal color.\nWring your jeans out over the bucket or basin to avoid staining the floor.\nFor a tie-dyed effect, tie rubber bands to the jeans before you submerge them. This will create a flowering pattern on the fabric."", ""1. Rinse the bleach off after five minutes. After you've finished applying the bleach or submerging your jeans, let them sit on the newspapers for five minutes. Then, rinse the jeans in cold water in either your sink or bathtub.\nWhile your jeans are still wet, you will not have a full sense of how bleach lightened the fabric. Wait until they've dried to assess their color."", '2. Run your jeans through the washing machine without detergent. Carry your jeans to the washing machine, wrapping them in newspapers to avoid staining the floor. Run your jeans through the washing machine without using fabric softener or detergent, which can yellow the jeans. This will rinse out excess bleach and make them safe to wash with other clothing later.\nPut the jeans alone in the washing machine, without other clothes, to avoid bleaching your other clothing.', '3. Air-dry your jeans. After the first time you wash your jeans, do not put them in the dryer (which can also cause yellowing). Instead, hang your jeans to dry to avoid the intense heat of a dryer. After your jeans have washed and dried, your jeans are ready to wear.', '4. After drying, check the color. Now that your jeans are dry, you can have an accurate understanding of the color. If your jeans are not light enough, repeat the process using the bleach solution. Repeat until the jeans have faded to your ideal color.']"
Education and Communications,"[""1. Read your assignment carefully. The style, structure, and focus of your essay will vary depending on the type of essay you are writing. If you've been assigned to write an essay for a class, review the assignment carefully and look for information about the nature of the essay. A few common types of essays include:\nThe compare/contrast essay, which focuses on analyzing the similarities and differences between 2 things, such as ideas, people, events, places, or works of art.\nThe narrative essay, which tells a story.\nThe argumentative essay, in which the writer uses evidence and examples to convince the reader of their point of view.\nThe critical or analytical essay, which examines something (such as a text or work of art) in detail. This type of essay may attempt to answer specific questions about the subject or focus more generally on its meaning.\nThe informative essay, that educates the reader about a topic."", '2. Check for formatting and style requirements. If you\'re writing an essay for a class or a publication, there may be specific formatting and style requirements you need to follow. Read your assignment carefully to make sure you understand requirements such as:\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Taylor, PhD\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAdjunct Assistant Professor of English\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tChristopher Taylor is an Adjunct Assistant Professor of English at Austin Community College in Texas.

Narrow down your topic so your essay has a clear focus. Depending on your assignment, you may already have a specific topic you are supposed to write about, or you may simply be asked to write about a general theme or subject. If the assignment doesn't specify your topic, take some time to brainstorm. Try to pick a subject that's specific, interesting to you, and that you think will give you plenty of material to work with.\nIf you're doing a research-based essay, you might find some inspiration from reading through some of the major sources on the subject.\nFor a critical essay, you might choose to focus on a particular theme in the work you're discussing, or analyze the meaning of a specific passage."", ""4. Ask for clarification if you don't understand the assignment. If you're not sure what you're supposed to be writing about or how to structure your essay, don't hesitate to ask! Your instructor can help clarify anything you don't understand, and they may even be able to provide examples of the type of work they're looking for.\nIf you're having trouble narrowing down your topic, your instructor might be able to provide guidance or inspiration."", ""1. Find some reputable sources on your topic. If you're writing an academic essay, or any type of essay that requires you to support your claims with evidence and examples, you'll probably need to do some research. Head to your library or go online to find up-to-date sources that provide accurate, verifiable information about your topic.Tip: In general, Wikipedia articles are not considered appropriate sources for academic writing. However, you may be able to find useful sources in the “References” section at the end of the article.\n\nAcademic books and journals tend to be good sources of information. In addition to print sources, you may be able to find reliable information in scholarly databases such as JSTOR and Google Scholar.\nYou can also look for primary source documents, such as letters, eyewitness accounts, and photographs.\nAlways evaluate your sources critically. Even research papers by reputable academics can contain hidden biases, outdated information, and simple errors or faulty logic."", ""2. Make notes as you do your research. As you're researching your topic, keep detailed notes about relevant information, ideas that interest you, and questions that you need to explore further. If you plan to use any of the information that you find in your paper, write down detailed citation information. This will allow you to find the information again and cite it properly.\nYou might find it helpful to write your notes down on individual note cards or enter them into a text document on your computer so you can easily copy, paste, and rearrange them however you like.\nTry organizing your notes into different categories so you can identify specific ideas you'd like to focus on. For example, if you're analyzing a short story, you might put all your notes on a particular theme or character together."", ""3. Choose a question to answer or an issue to address. As you do your research, you will likely find yourself narrowing your focus even further. For example, you might discover that there is a particular question you want to answer, or that there's a popular argument or theory about your topic that you'd like to try to disprove. This question or issue will form the basis for your thesis, or main argument.\nFor example, if your essay is about the factors that led to the end of the Bronze Age in the ancient Middle East, you might focus on the question, “What role did natural disasters play in the collapse of Late Bronze Age society?”"", ""4. Create a thesis statement that summarizes your main argument. Once you've hit on a specific question or idea you'd like to address in your essay, look at your research and think about the major point or argument you'd like to make. Try to summarize your main point concisely, in 1-2 sentences. This will be your thesis statement.\nOne easy way to come up with a thesis statement is to briefly answer the main question you would like to address.\nFor example, if the question is “What role did natural disasters play in the collapse of Late Bronze Age society?” then your thesis might be, “Natural disasters during the Late Bronze Age destabilized local economies across the region. This set in motion a series of mass migrations of different peoples, creating widespread conflict that contributed to the collapse of several major Bronze Age political centers.”"", ""5. Write an outline to help organize your main points. After you've created a clear thesis, briefly list the major points you will be making in your essay. You don't need to include a lot of detail—just write 1-2 sentences, or even a few words, outlining what each point or argument will be. Include sub-points addressing the evidence and examples you'll be using to back up each point.\nWhen you write the outline, think about how you would like to organize your essay. For example, you might start with your strongest arguments and then move to the weakest ones. Or, you could begin with a general overview of the source you're analyzing and then move on to addressing the major themes, tone, and style of the work.\nYour outline might look like this:\nIntroduction\nBody\nPoint 1, with supporting examples\nPoint 2, with supporting examples\nPoint 3, with supporting examples\nMajor counter-argument(s) to your thesis\nYour rebuttals to the counter-argument(s)\n\nConclusion"", ""1. Write an introduction to provide context. Once you've written your thesis and outline, write an introduction to your essay. This should consist of a brief, general overview of your topic, along with your thesis statement. This is the place to provide information that will help orient the reader and put the rest of your essay in context.Tip: Some writers find it helpful to write the introduction after they've written the rest of the essay. Once you've written out your main points, it's easier to summarize the gist of your essay in a few introductory sentences.\n\nFor example, if you're writing a critical essay about a work of art, your introduction might start with some basic information about the work, such as who created it, when and where it was created, and a brief description of the work itself. From there, introduce the question(s) about the work you'd like to address, and present your thesis.\nA strong introduction should also contain a brief transitional sentence that creates a link to the first point or argument you would like to make. For example, if you're discussing the use of color in a work of art, lead in by saying you'd like to start with an overview of symbolic color use in contemporary works by other artists."", ""2. Present your argument(s) in detail. Working from your outline, write a series of paragraphs addressing each of the major points you'd like to make. Each paragraph should contain a topic sentence, which is like a miniature thesis—it briefly explains the main point you are trying to make with your paragraph. Follow up your topic sentence with a few concrete examples to support your point.\nFor example, your topic sentence might be something like, “Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories are among the many literary influences apparent in P. G. Wodehouse's Jeeves novels.” You could then back this up by quoting a passage that contains a reference to Sherlock Holmes.\nTry to show how the arguments in each paragraph link back to the main thesis of your essay."", ""3. Use transition sentences between paragraphs. Your essay will flow better if you build connections or smooth transitions between your arguments. Try to find logical ways to link each paragraph or topic to the one before or after.\nWhen creating transitions, transitional phrases can be helpful. For example, use words and phrases such as “In addition,” “Therefore,” “Similarly,” “Subsequently,” or “As a result.”\nFor example, if you've just discussed the use of color to create contrast in a work of art, you might start the next paragraph with, “In addition to color, the artist also uses different line weights to distinguish between the more static and dynamic figures in the scene.”"", ""4. Address possible counterarguments. If you're writing an argumentative essay, get familiar with the major arguments against your point of view. You'll need to incorporate those counterarguments into your essay and present convincing evidence against them.\nFor example, if you're arguing that a particular kind of shrimp decorates its shell with red algae in order to attract a mate, you'll need to address the counterargument that the shell decoration is actually a warning to predators. You might do this by presenting evidence that the red shrimp are in fact more likely to get eaten than shrimp with undecorated shells."", ""5. Cite your sources properly. If you plan to use someone else's ideas or information that you got from another source, you will need to credit the source of your information. This is true whether you're quoting another source directly or simply summarizing or paraphrasing their words or ideas.\nThe way you cite your sources will vary depending on the citation style you're using. Typically, you'll need to include the name of the author, the title and publication date of the source, and location information such as the page number on which the information appears.\nIn general, you don't need to cite common knowledge. For example, if you say, “A zebra is a type of mammal,” you probably won't need to cite a source.\nIf you've cited any sources in the essay, you'll need to include a list of works cited (or a bibliography) at the end."", ""6. Wrap up with a concluding paragraph. To finish off your essay, write a paragraph that briefly reiterates the main point of your essay. State how your arguments support your thesis and briefly summarize your major insights or arguments. You might also discuss questions that are still unanswered or ideas that merit further exploration.\nKeep your conclusion brief. While the appropriate length will vary based on the length of the essay, it should typically be no longer than 1-2 paragraphs.\nFor example, if you're writing a 1,000-word essay, your conclusion should be about 4-5 sentences long."", ""1. Take a break after finishing your first draft. After drafting your essay, it's a good idea to take some time away from it. That way, you can come back to it and look at it again with a fresh perspective. If possible, take 1-2 days before you look at it again.\nIf you don't have time to spend a couple of days away from your essay, at least take a few hours to relax or work on something else."", ""2. Read over your draft to check for obvious problems. When you're ready to work on your essay again, first read it over to look for any major problems. You might find it helpful to read the essay out loud, since your ears can pick up on things your eyes might miss. If you spot anything, make a note of it, but don't try to fix it right away. Look out for issues such as:\nExcessive wordiness\nPoints that aren't explained clearly enough\nTangents or unnecessary information\nUnclear transitions or illogical organization\nSpelling, grammar, style, and formatting problems\nInappropriate language or tone (e.g., slang or informal language in an academic essay)"", ""3. Correct any major problems you find. Once you've read over your essay, go through and edit it. When you're done, go back over the essay again to make sure it flows well and that there aren't any problems you missed.\nYou might have to cut material from your essay in some places and add new material in others.\nYou might also end up reordering some of the content of the essay if you think that helps it flow better."", ""4. Proofread your revised essay. After editing your essay, go over it again closely to spot any minor errors, such as typos or formatting problems. There may be issues that you missed during your initial round of editing, and there could also be new typos or formatting issues if you made changes to the original draft. You may find it easier to spot these errors on a printout rather than on an electronic version of your essay.Tip: If possible, have someone else check your work. When you've been looking at your own writing for too long, your brain begins to fill in what it expects to see rather than what's actually there, making it harder for you to spot mistakes.\n\nRead over each line slowly and carefully. It may be helpful to read each sentence out loud to yourself.""]"
Personal Care and Style,"['1. Purchase an anti-fog product to treat your glasses at home. Many companies manufacture products specifically designed to prevent glasses from fogging. These are either a spray or gel and, when applied directly to your lens, will reduce fog by forming a barrier that protects against moisture condensing.\nMost products require you to spray both sides of the lens, let dry, and wipe clean with a soft, dry cloth. Some products suggest longer dry times, while others require the spray or gel be rinsed off prior to wiping. Check product packaging for specific instructions.', ""2. Purchase anti-fog wipes for on-the-go protection. These pre-treated cloths are convenient and easy to use. Simply wipe both sides of the lens using the pre-packaged wipe. These wipes are made for only one use, so just throw it away when you're finished."", '3. Invest in a professional anti-fog treatment for a longer lasting solution. Check with your eye doctor about the availability and cost of applying a one-time coating to your lenses to permanently prevent fog. This option may be particularly useful when there are drastic and/or frequent temperature changes or if the fog creates a safety hazard.\nBe prepared to leave your glasses for a few days and spend between $50-$100.', '1. Apply shaving cream to your lenses to create a protective barrier. Before going out in the cold weather, blot a small amount of shaving cream to both sides of your lenses and rub in. Let the shaving cream dry before gently removing residue with a soft, dry cloth.\nSome people even say that shaving cream works longer than store-bought products!', '2. Rub bar soap on your lenses to create a clear, protective layer. Apply a small amount, let dry, and gently remove residue with a soft, dry cloth. The soap works just as the shaving cream does and will leave your lenses clear and fog-free.', '3. Spit on your lenses if you are in a bind! You can put a bit of spit on both sides of your lenses and wipe off with a soft, dry cloth. Only try this option if you have no others, as your saliva may contain oils or other substances that could potentially harm your lenses.', '1. Pull your glasses away from your face. Your glasses trap heat and moisture when too close to your face or eyes, which increases the incidence of fog build up. Try moving your glasses further down your nose to allow for more air circulation and less fog.', ""2. Check to make sure your clothing isn't obstructing the air flow. Items like scarves and high-collared coats can trap moisture and push it upwards, leading to fogging. Also, wearing lots of layers can increase your body temperature and perspiration, which may also contribute to your glasses fogging up.\nIf you can’t avoid wearing this type of clothing, try unzipping your coat or letting your scarf hang open to allow for more air flow. Alternatively, try tucking the clothing under your chin so your breath can flow outward instead of up.\nDuring exercise, try using a sweatband to soak up sweat and reduce perspiration."", '3. Avoid storing your glasses in the cold weather. Putting cold glasses on a warm body makes for an even bigger fog effect with temperature change. Instead, keep your glasses inside the house (instead of your car) to help reduce fogging when you move from warm to cold spaces.']"
Health,"[""1. Find someone who wants to be hypnotized. It is not very difficult to hypnotize someone who doesn't want it. If you are a beginner hypnotist then great it is what every one wants. Find a willing partner who wants to be hypnotized and is willing to be patient and relaxed for the best results.\nDo not hypnotize someone with a history of mental or psychotic disorders, as this can lead to unintended and dangerous consequences."", ""2. Choose a quiet, comfortable room. You want your participant to feel safe and free from distraction. There should only be dim lights and the room needs to be clean. Have them sit in a comfy chair and remove any potential distractions, like TVs or other people.\nTurn off all cell phones and music or any devices that could cause noise.\nClose the windows if there is noise outside.\nLet other people you live with know that they shouldn't bother you until you both come out."", '3. Let them know what to expect from hypnosis. Most people have wildly inaccurate ideas of hypnosis from movies and TV. In reality, it is mostly a relaxation technique that helps people gain clarity on problems or issues in their subconscious. We actually enter states hypnosis all the time -- in daydreams, when absorbed in music or movies, or when ""spacing out."" With real hypnosis:\nYou are not asleep or unconscious, ever.\nYou are not under a spell or someone\'s control.\nYou will not do anything you don\'t want to do.', '4. Ask their goals for being hypnotized. Hypnosis has been shown to decrease anxious thoughts and even raise your immune system strength. It is a great tool for increasing focus, especially before a test or big event, and can be used for deep relaxation in times of stress. Knowing your subjects goals with hypnosis will help you ease them into a trance state.', '5. Ask your partner if they have been hypnotized before and what it was like. If they have, ask them what they were told to do and how they responded. This will give you an idea of how responsive the partner will be to your own suggestions, and perhaps what things in you should avoid.\nPeople who have been hypnotized before usually have an easier time being hypnotized again.', '1. Speak in a low, slow, soothing, voice. Take your time when talking, keeping your voice calm and collected. Draw out your sentences a little longer than usual. Imagine you are trying to calm down a frightened or worrying person, letting your voice be an example. Keep this tone of voice throughout the entire interaction. Some good words to start with include:\n""Let my words wash over you, and take the suggestions as you desire them.""\n""Everything here is safe, calm, and peaceful. Let yourself sink into the couch/chair as your relax deeply.""\n""Your eyes may feel heavy and want to close. Let your body sink naturally down as your muscles relax. Listen to your body and my voice as you begin to feel calm.""\n""You are in complete control of this time. You will only accept those suggestions which are for your benefit and that you are willing to accept.""', '2. Ask them to focus on regular, deep breaths. Try and get them to take deep, organized breaths in and out. Help them develop regular breathing by lining it up with yours. You should be specific: ""Breathe in deeply now, filling your chest and lungs,"" as you breath in as well, followed by an exhalation and the words ""slowly let the air out of your chest, completely emptying your lungs.\nFocused breathing gets oxygen to the brain and gives the person something to think about other than hypnosis, stress, or their environment.', '3. Have them focus their gaze on a fixed point. It can be your forehead if you\'re right in front of them or a dimly lit object in the room. Tell them to choose an object, any object, and rest their eyes on it. This is where the stereotype of the dangling watch comes from, as this small object is actually not a terrible thing for someone to look it. If they feel relaxed enough to close their eyes, let them.\nPay attention to their eyes from time to time. If they seem like they are darting around, give them some guidance. ""I want you to pay attention to that poster on the wall,"" or ""try and focus on the space right between my eyebrows."" Tell them to ""Let their eyes and eyelids relax, growing heavy.""\nIf you want them to focus on you, you need to stay relatively still.', '4. Get them to relax their body part by part. Once you have them relatively calm, breathing regularly, and in-tune with your voice, ask them to relax their toes and feet. Have them focus on just letting go of these muscles, then move up to the calves. Ask them to relax their lower leg, then their upper leg, and so on up to the face muscles. From there you can circle back around to their back, shoulders, arms, and fingers.\nTake your time and keep your voice slow and calm. If they seem twitchy or tense, slow down and re-do the process in reverse.\n""Relax your feet and ankles. Feel the muscles lighten and loosen in your feet, as if they require no effort to maintain.""', '5. Encourage them to feel more relaxed. Direct the attention with suggestions. Let them know they are feeling calm and relaxed. While you have a lot of things you can say, the goal is to encourage them to sink even deeper into themselves, focusing on relaxation with each inhalation and exhalation.\n""You can feel your eyelids getting heavy. Let them drift and fall.""\n""You are letting yourself slip deeper and deeper into a calm, peaceful trance.\n""You can feel yourself relaxing now. You can feel a heavy, relaxed feeling coming over you. And as I continue to talk, that heavy relaxed feeling will get stronger and stronger, until it carries you into a deep, peaceful state of relaxation.""', '6. Use your partner\'s breathing and body language as a guide to their mental state. Repeat the suggestions a few times, much as you might repeat the verses and choruses of a song, until your partner appears to be totally relaxed. Look for signs of tension in their eyes (are they darting?), their fingers and toes (are they tapping or wiggling) and their breathing (is it shallow and irregular) and keep working on your relaxation techniques until they seem calm and relaxed.\n""Every word that I utter is putting you faster and deeper, and faster and deeper, into a calm, peaceful state of relaxation.""\n""Sinking down, and shutting down. Sinking down, and shutting down. Sinking down, and shutting down, shutting down completely.""\n""And the deeper you go, the deeper you are able to go. And the deeper you go, the deeper you want to go, and the more enjoyable the experience becomes.""', '7. Walk them down the ""hypnotic staircase."" This technique is shared by hypnotherapists and self-hypnotists alike to bring about a state of deep trance. Ask your subject to imagine themselves at the top of a long staircase in a warm, quiet room. As they step down, they feel themselves sinking deeper into relaxation. Each step brings them deeper into their own mind. As they walk, let them know there are ten steps, and guide them down each one.\n""Take the first step down and feel yourself sinking deeper into relaxation. Each step is a step further into your subconscious. You step down the second step and feel yourself getting calmer and calmer. When you reach the third step, your body feels as if it is floating blissfully away... etc.""\nIt can help to envision a door at the bottom as well, leading them to  a state of pure relaxation.', ""1. Know that telling someone what to do under hypnosis often doesn't work, and is a violation of trust. In addition, most people will remember what they did under hypnosis, so even if you can get them to pretend they are a chicken, they won't be happy. Hypnosis, however, has many therapeutic benefits outside of a cheesy Las Vegas show. Help your subject relax and let go of their problems or worries instead of trying to play a practical joke.\nEven well-intentioned suggestions can have bad results if you don't know what you are doing. This is why licensed hypnotherapists usually help the patient determine the right course of action instead of trying to give it to them as a suggestion."", '2. Use basic hypnosis lower anxiety levels. Hypnosis reduces anxiety, no matter what your suggestions are, so don\'t feel like you need to ""fix"" anyone. Simply putting someone in a trance state is a fantastic way to lower stress levels and anxiety. The act of deep relaxation, without trying to ""solve"" anything, is so rare in daily life that it can put problems and worries in perspective all by itself.', '3. Ask them to envision solutions to possible problems. Instead of telling someone how to fix an issue, have them imagine themselves already succeeding. What does success look and feel like to them? How did they get there?\nWhat is their preferred future? What has changed to get them there?', '4. Know that hypnosis can be used for a variety of mental afflictions. While you should seek out the advice of a trained mental health professional, hypnotherapy has been used for addiction, pain relief, phobias, self-esteem issues, and more. While you should never try and ""fix"" someone, hypnosis can be an excellent tool to help someone heal themselves.\nHelp them envision the world beyond their problems -- imagine them going through a day without smoking, or visualize a moment they are proud of to raise self-esteem.\nHealing through hypnosis is always easier if they person wants to work on the issue before they enter the trance state.', '5. Know that hypnosis is only a small part of any mental health solution. The key benefits of hypnosis are relaxation and time to muse safely on an issue. It is both deep relaxation and focused attention on an issue at the same time. However, hypnosis is not a miracle cure or quick fix, it is simply a way to help people dive deeper into their own mind. This sort of self-reflection is critical to strong mental health, but serious or chronic issues should always be treated by a trained and certified professional.', '1. Slowly take them out of their trance state. You don\'t want to jerk them out of their relaxation. Let them know that they are becoming more aware of their surroundings. Tell them that they will come back to full awareness, alert and awake, after you count to five. If you feel like they are deeply in a trance, have them walk back up the ""staircase"" with you, gaining awareness with each step.\nBegin by saying, ""I\'m going to count from one to five, and at the count of five you will be feeling wide awake, fully alert, and completely refreshed.""', ""2. Discuss the hypnosis with the partner to see help you improve in the future. Ask them what felt right to them, what threatened to take them out of hypnosis, and what they felt. This will help you get people under more effectively next time, and help them learn what they enjoyed about the process.\nDon't pressure anyone to talk immediately. Simply open a conversation, and wait to talk until later if they seem relaxed and want some time to stay quiet."", '3. Prepare for commonly asked questions in the future. It\'s good to have a general idea about how to answer questions like these ahead of time, because confidence and trust are so important in determining how a person is going to respond to your induction. Common questions you might get at any point in the process include:\n\nWhat are you going to do? I will ask you to visualize some pleasant scenes, while I talk about how to use your own mental abilities more effectively. You can always refuse to do anything that you don\'t want to do, and you can always come out of the experience yourself if an emergency should come up.\n\nWhat does it feel like to be in hypnosis? Most of us experience changes in our conscious awareness several times a day without realizing it. Any time you let your imagination go and just flow along with a piece of music or a verse of poetry, or get so involved in watching a movie or a television drama that you feel like you\'re part of the action instead of a part of the audience, you are experiencing a form of trance. Hypnosis is just a way of helping you to focus and define these changes in consciousness, in order to use your mental abilities more effectively.\n\nIs it safe? Hypnosis is not an altered state of consciousness (as sleep is, for example), but an altered experience of consciousness. You will never do something you don\'t want to do or be forced into thoughts against your will.\n\nIf it\'s all just your imagination, then, what good is it? Don’t be confused by the tendency in English and many other languages to use the word ""imaginary"" as opposite in meaning to the word ""real"" -- and neither should it be confused with the term ""image."" The imagination is a very real group of mental abilities, whose potential we are just now beginning to explore, and which extends far beyond our ability to form mental images!\n\nCan you make me do anything I don\'t want to do? When you\'re using hypnosis, you still have your own personality, and you\'re still you -- so you won\'t say or do anything that you wouldn\'t do in the very same situation without hypnosis, and you can easily refuse any suggestion that you don\'t want to accept. (That\'s why we call them ""suggestions."")\n\nWhat can I do in order to respond better? Hypnosis is very similar to letting yourself become absorbed in watching a sunset or the embers of a campfire, letting yourself flow with a piece of music or poetry, or feeling like you are part of the action instead of part of the audience when you are watching a movie. It all depends on your ability and willingness to go along with the instructions and suggestions that are provided.\n\nWhat if I enjoy it so much that I don\'t want to come back? Hypnotic suggestions are basically an exercise for the mind and the imagination, just like a movie script is. But you still come back to everyday life when the session is over, just like you come back at the end of a movie. However, the hypnotist might need to try a couple times to pull you out. It is enjoyable being completely relaxed, but you can\'t do much when hypnotized.\n\nWhat if it doesn\'t work? Did you ever become so absorbed in your play as a child that you didn’t hear your mother’s voice calling you in for dinner? Or are you one of the many people who are able to wake up at a certain time each morning, just by deciding the night before that you are going to do so? We all have the ability to use our minds in ways we are not usually aware of, and some of us have developed these abilities more than others. If you just allow your thoughts to respond freely and naturally to the words and images as your guide, you\'ll be able to go wherever your mind can take you']"
Food and Entertaining,"['1. Measure the rice with a cup and put it into your cooking pot. Some rice cookers have a removable bowl or pot, while others must have the rice placed directly in the cooker. Most of the time, rice cookers will come with a measuring ""cup"" or scoop that can fit 3/4 cup (180 mL). Alternatively, use an ordinary measuring cup.\nOne cup (240 mL) of uncooked rice will generate anywhere from 1 1/2 cups (360 mL) to three cups (720 mL) of cooked rice, depending on variety.  Leave enough space for this expansion to prevent the rice cooker from spilling over.', '2. Rinse the rice if necessary. Many people prefer to rinse rice in order to remove any pesticides, herbicides, or contaminants that may be present. Some less modern milling practices also create broken grains that release excess starch into the rice, which needs to be rinsed off to prevent the rice clumping together. If you decide to rinse the rice, pour drinking water into the bowl or hold it under the faucet. Stir as you add the water, until the rice is fully submerged. Drain water through a sieve or tip the bowl slowly while catching fallen rice grains with your hand. If the water looks discolored or filled with floating bits of broken rice or dirt, rinse a second or third time until new water added looks relatively clear.\nWhite rice sold in the United States is required by law to be enriched with powdered iron, niacin, thiamin, or folic acid; these vitamins and minerals are usually removed by washing.\nIf your rice cooker has a non-stick bowl, wash the rice (prior to cooking) in a colander with several washes/rinses/drains.  Replacement non-stick bowls are very expensive.', '3. Measure the water. Most rice cooker instructions recommend cold water. How much water you add depends on what kind of rice you\'re cooking and how moist you prefer it. There are often graduated marks on the inside of a rice cooker, indicating how much rice and water should be added, or instructions on the package of rice. Alternatively, use the following suggested amounts depending on your variety of rice, but keep in mind you can always adjust these in future if you prefer your rice more chewy or soft:\nWhite, long grain - 1 3/4 cups of water per 1 cup of rice (420 mL water per 240 mL rice)\nWhite, medium grain - 1 1/2 cups of water per 1 cup of rice (360 mL water per 240 mL rice)\nWhite, short grain - 1 1/4 cups of water per 1 cup of rice (300 mL water per 240 mL rice)\nBrown, long grain - 2 1/4 cups of water per 1 cup of rice (520 mL water per 240 mL rice)\nSold as ""parboiled"" (not half-cooked at home) - 2 cups of water per 1 cup of rice\nFor Indian style rices like Basmati or Jasmine, less water is needed as a drier rice is desired, use no more than 1 1/2 cups of water per 1 cup of rice.  Use only 1 to 1 if you washed the rice previously.  It is ok to add bay leaves or cardamom pods directly to the rice cooker to enhance the flavor.', '4. Soak the rice for thirty minutes, if desired. This is not required, but some people soak the rice to shorten the cooking time. Soaking may also make the cooked rice stickier. Use the amount of water measured earlier to soak the rice at room temperature, then use this same water for cooking.', '5. Add flavorings (optional). Flavorings should be added to the water before you start the rice cooker, so the rice will absorb these flavors during cooking. Many people prefer to add a little bit of salt for flavor at this time. Butter or oil are another common option. If you are making Indian style rice, you may wish to add a few cardamom seeds or a bay leaf.', '6. Push the rice grains off the sides and under the water level. Use a wooden or plastic utensil to move any rice grains around the pot back into the water. Rice left above the water surface may burn during cooking. If water or rice spilled over the edge, wipe the outside of the pot with a cloth or rag.\nYou do not need to stir the rice under the water level. This may release excess starch and result in clumpier or stickier rice.', ""7. Check your rice cooker for special options. Some rice cookers simply have an on/off switch. Others have different settings for brown or white rice, or the ability to delay the cooking until a specified time period has passed. You are unlikely to run into problems if you just go with the basic settings, but it's a good idea to figure out what each button or option does if possible."", ""8. Cook the rice in the rice cooker. If your rice cooker has a removable cooking pot, place the pot of rice and water back into the rice cooker. Close the lid of the cooker, plug the cooker in, and press the switch to turn it on. The switch will click, like a toaster, when the rice is done. In most rice cookers, the rice will be warmed until you unplug the cooker.\nDon't lift the lid to check on the rice. The cooking process depends on the development of steam inside the pot, so letting steam escape by opening the lid may result in improperly cooked rice.\nThe rice cooker automatically turns off when the temperature inside the pot exceeds waters boiling point (212 degrees F or 100 degrees C at sea level), which will not happen until all the free water has vaporized."", '9. Allow the rice to ""rest"" for 10-15 minutes before removing the lid (optional). This is not required but is commonly recommended in rice cooker instructions, and is automatic in some models. Unplugging the rice cooker or taking the pot off of the heat for this period will minimize the amount of rice that sticks to the pot.', '10. Fluff and serve. Once there is no water left, the rice should be ready to eat. Using a fork or other utensil to stir the rice after cooking will break up clumps and release steam, preventing the rice from overcooking.\nIf the rice is not ready to eat, see troubleshooting.', '1. Reduce water levels next time if the rice is mushy. Next time you make rice, use 1/4–1/2 cup (30–60 mL) less water per cup (240 mL) of rice. This should cook the rice for a shorter period of time, and give it less water to absorb.', '2. Add more water and cook on the stove if the rice is undercooked. If the rice turns out too chewy or dry for your liking, move it to the stovetop with 1/4 cup (30 mL) of water. Cook covered for a few minutes to steam the rice.\nAdding it back to the rice cooker without enough water to cover it could result in burning, or the rice cooker failing to turn on.\nNext time, simply add about 1/4–1/2 cup (30–60mL) of water per cup (240 mL) rice to the rice cooker before you turn it on.', '3. Remove rice promptly after cooking if the rice is frequently burned. A working rice cooker shouldn\'t burn rice during the cooking, but if left in ""warming"" mode, the rice at the bottom and sides can get burned. If this happens often, remove rice from the cooker as soon as you hear the ""click"" signifying it is done (or when the warming light goes on).\nOn some cookers, you can turn off the warming option entirely, but in this case, you should still eat or refrigerate the rice before it cools to reduce the risk of food poisoning.\nIf you are cooking other ingredients with the rice, those can burn during cooking. Next time, remove any sugary ingredients and cook separately, or any ingredients that you notice burning.', '4. Find a use for overcooked rice. Mushy, split grains can still be tasty if used in the right recipe. Consider these options to make the mushy texture less noticeable:\nFry it to remove that excess moisture\nTurn it into a sweet dessert\nAdd it to any soup, baby food, or homemade meatballs', '5. Adjust for altitude. If you live at 3,000 feet (910 m) or above, you may notice your rice ends up undercooked. If this happens, add an extra 1/4–1/2 cup of water per cup of rice (30–60 mL water per 240 mL rice). The lower air pressure at high altitude causes water to boil at a lower temperature, so the rice will take longer to cook. The more water you add to a rice cooker, the longer it will continue to cook.\nConsult the rice cooker instructions or contact the manufacturer if you cannot find the correct amount of additional water. The amount necessary varies with altitude.', ""6. Deal with leftover water. If there is water left over in a rice cooker after it's finished cooking, the rice cooker model is likely defective and may need to be replaced. For the current batch of rice, drain the water and serve if the rice texture suits your preferences. Otherwise, turn the rice cooker back on until the water is used up."", '7. Finished.']"
Arts and Entertainment,"[""1. Run the thermometer under hot water for a quick fix. If you're trying to convince someone you have a fever, you may need to fake a thermometer reading. One way to increase the temperature on a thermometer is to use hot water. Place the tip under a tap with warm water, and leave it there until you see the temperature go over 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit (38.1 degrees Celsius).\nNotice the term 'quick fix.' This usually only lasts for about 2-3 minutes, maybe 4.\nDon't let the thermometer heat past 102 degrees Fahrenheit (39 degrees Celsius)-you could be busted for lying or get rushed to the hospital unnecessarily! The latter will probably happen if it is still a possible temperature, but if it rises above 107 degrees Fahrenheit (42 degrees Celsius) you will most certainly be seen as a faker."", ""2. Shake a mercury thermometer to increase the reading. Shaking a mercury thermometer while holding the tip can make the temperature higher. Be careful, though, because if you are too violent, it will reach an impossibly high temperature and you will be busted for lying. Also, don't shake so hard that you shatter the glass.\nA mercury thermometer is the type that has a metal tip on 1 end. The rest of the thermometer is glass and has numbers printed on it. The mercury rises in the thermometer to show the temperature.\nHold it by the metal tip when shaking it. Point the rest of the thermometer towards the floor, and shake it back and forth so that the temperature reading increases."", '3. Heat a digital thermometer by rubbing the tip between your fingers. Hold the thermometer as still as you can with 1 hand. Hold the tip of the thermometer in between your thumb and index finger on the other hand. Rub your thumb and finger together as fast as you can to raise the reading on the thermometer.\nA digital thermometer is usually a plastic frame with a metal tip and a digital readout on the other end.', ""4. Eat or drink something warm before having your temp taken by mouth. This works great if you know that someone will be watching you take your temperature. Eat or drink something warm, like soup or tea, just before they take your temperature. Hold a little bit of the food or drink in your mouth for a few seconds before swallowing. You can wait until someone comes in to watch you to take your temperature, then swallow quickly. \nYou could even save some of the warm liquid under your tongue to stick the thermometer in during the reading.\nDon’t make the drink so hot that you burn your mouth. It should feel comfortable in your mouth, not painful.\nIn some cases, if you have a trusting parent, you can read out what the thermometer ”says” to them. As long as they don't see it, and it's not too far from your real temp."", ""1. Heat your forehead with a hot water bottle or heating pad. Press a hot water bottle against your forehead for a few minutes to make it feel warm to the touch. Alternatively, use a heating pad on a low setting to warm your forehead, but make sure you put something between your face and the heating pad, such as a towel. You don't want to burn yourself!\nWhen someone comes in to check on you and feels your forehead, it’ll be warm enough that they’ll think you have a fever.\nThe hot water bottle trick is a classic one when faking a fever, and has been used for decades with great success."", '2. Eat spicy foods to raise your temperature naturally. Spicy foods, like jalapeños, chiles, or peppers, can actually increase your body temperature. If you have something like this on hand, eat a little bit to raise your temperature naturally. Don’t overdo it, though—you don’t want to get sick or be in serious pain from eating something too spicy!\nIf you overdo it and eat something too spicy, drink some milk. This will help mitigate some of that heat.\nAnother great option to try is a bowl of curry. Try eating that for lunch before faking your symptoms.', '3. Exercise or hide out under a blanket to make yourself look flushed. The simplest thing to do is to cover your head with a blanket for a few minutes. The reflected heat will make you look flushed, as well as increase the temperature of your forehead.\nAlternatively, do some exercises, like jumping jacks or jogging in place, to make your face flushed. The added rosiness to your skin will make the fever act more believable.', ""4. Press a washcloth to your skin or spritz your face to make yourself sweaty. Run a washcloth under warm water for a few minutes. Once it's warm, place it over your face, leave it there for a few minutes, then take it off. Alternatively, spritz your face with a fine mist from a spray bottle full of water, instead.\nMake sure your face isn’t soaked—you only want the appearance of sweaty, clammy skin."", ""1. Say that you’re cold, not hot. People with a fever often feel cold, even though their skin is warm to the touch. If someone comes to check on you, be sure you’re under the covers or are wearing warm clothes. Tell them you’re cold and think you have a fever.\nAdd a few subtle shivers in to make your act more convincing. You don't have to shake your entire body; a trembling jaw will go a long way."", ""2. Act like you’re tired. If you want to fake a fever, you can't be bouncing around like you feel good. You need to be dragging your feet and acting like you don't have any energy. For example:\nWhen you're sitting down, lean against your arm, like you can hardly keep your head up.\nIf you're standing, allow your body to slouch forward. You can even slump to the side and stumble a bit.\nTry lowering your gaze so that your eyes are partially closed. This will make them look as if they’re too heavy to fully open."", '3. Pretend that you don’t have an appetite. Another symptom of a fever is a lack of appetite. If someone asks if they can get you anything, don’t ask for a hamburger and fries! Instead, ask for water, tea, or juice. Save the snacking for when you’re all alone, or ask for something simple, like toast or soup.\nIf you really want to make an impact, turn down even your most favorite food. This may help people believe that you really are ""sick.""', '4. Sniffle, sneeze, or cough to fake a cold. Cold symptoms often go hand in hand with a fever, so you could add a few sniffles, a cough, or sneeze to your act. Scatter some tissues around your bed or room to make it look more believable.\nEating spicy food can also make your nose run!', '5. Fake a headache or stomachache instead of a cold. If you aren’t confident faking cold symptoms, complain of either a headache or a stomachache instead. Hold the part of your body that you say doesn’t feel good. If you pretend to have a stomachache, go to the bathroom and wait for longer than usual before coming back out.\nFor instance, you could say, “My tummy really hurts"" or ""My head feels like it is spinning.""', ""6. Don’t overdo it. Your act should be realistic, not dramatic and unbelievable. Add only 1 or 2 symptoms to the “fever” and don’t act as though you are dying from a mystery illness. If you take it too far, the person could either realize you’re faking or believe the act and want to take you to the doctor.\nFor instance, you don't want to be coughing, saying you need to vomit, and moaning while you roll on the floor. That's a bit too much."", '1. Admit you’re faking if someone confronts you. If your parent catches you heating up the thermometer or pressing a hot water bottle to your head, admit that you are trying to fake a fever. Though you might be tempted to deny what you’re doing, continuing the act when you’ve already been caught will only get you in more trouble.\nFor instance, you could say, “You’re right, Mom. I was only pretending to be sick.”', '2. Explain why you’re faking sick. Your parents are likely going to be pretty upset that you were taking such extreme measures to stay home from school, practice, or other obligations. Be honest about the reason you don’t want to go, rather than creating more lies. Share your feelings without making excuses.\nFor example, you could say, “I have a huge history test today and I didn’t study. I was faking sick so that I wouldn’t fail the test.”', '3. Apologize for lying. Now that you’ve come clean, sincerely apologize for trying to trick them. Make it clear that you know what you did is wrong, and agree to be more honest in the future. Recognize that they might find it hard to trust you now that you’ve been caught in a lie.\nFor example, you could say, ""I\'m sorry for what I did. I understand that it was wrong, and I promise to never do it again.""', ""4. Accept the consequences. Your parents might ground you, take away privileges, or otherwise discipline you for lying. Rather than arguing or talking back, accept the consequences for lying and avoid doing it again.\nDon't worry about getting punished; it's not the end of the world. You can work to earn back their trust by being honest, responsible, and helpful.""]"
Education and Communications,"[""1. Set up the equation. On a piece of paper, write the dividend (number being divided) on the right, under the division symbol, and the divisor (number doing the division) to the left on the outside.\nThe quotient (answer) will eventually go on top, right above the dividend.\nLeave yourself plenty of space below the equation to carry out multiple subtraction operations.\nHere's an example: if there are six mushrooms in a 250-gram pack, how much does each mushroom weigh on average? In this case, we must divide 250 by 6. The 6 goes on the outside, and the 250 on the inside."", ""2. Divide the first digit. Working from left to right, determine how many times the divisor can go into the first digit of the dividend without exceeding it.\nIn our example, you'd want to determine how many times 6 goes into 2. Since six is larger than two, the answer is zero. If you wish, may write a 0 directly above the 2 as a place-holder, and erase it later. Alternatively, you can leave that space blank and move on to the next step."", ""3. Divide the first two digits. If the divisor is a larger number than the first digit, determine how many times the divisor goes into the first two digits of the dividend without exceeding it.\nIf your answer to the previous step was 0, as in the example, expand the number by one digit. In this case, we'd ask how many times 6 can go into 25.\nIf your divisor has more than two digits, you'll have to expand out even further, to the third or maybe even fourth digit of the dividend in order to get a number that the divisor goes into.\nWork in terms of whole numbers. If you use a calculator, you'll discover that 6 goes into 25 a total of 4.167 times. In long division, you always round down to the nearest whole number, so in this case, our answer would be 4."", ""4. Enter the first digit of the quotient. Put the number of times the divisor goes into the first digit (or digits) of the dividend above the appropriate digit(s).\nIt is important in long division to make sure the columns of numbers remain correctly aligned. Work carefully, otherwise you may make an error that leads you to the wrong answer.\nIn the example, you would place a 4 above the 5, since we're putting 6 it into 25."", '1. Multiply the divisor. The divisor should be multiplied by the number you have just written above the dividend. In our example, this is the first digit of the quotient.', ""2. Record the product. Put the result of your multiplication in step 1 beneath the dividend.\nIn the example, 6 times 4 is 24. After you've written a 4 in the quotient, write the number 24 beneath the  25, again being careful to keep the numbers aligned."", '3. Draw a line. A line should be placed beneath the product of your multiplication, 24 in the example.', ""1. Subtract the product. Subtract the number you just wrote below the dividend from the digits of the dividend directly above it. Write the result beneath the line you just drew.\nIn the example, we'll subtract 24 from 25, getting 1.\nDo not subtract from the complete dividend, but only those digits you worked with in Parts One and Two. In the example, you should not subtract 24 from 250."", ""2. Bring down the next digit. Write the next digit of the dividend after the result of your subtraction operation.\nIn the example, because 6 can't go into 1 without exceeding it, you need to bring down another digit. In this case, you'll grab the 0 from 250 and place it after the 1, making it 10, which 6 can go into."", ""3. Repeat the whole process. Divide the new number by your divisor, and write the result above the dividend as the next digit of the quotient.\nIn the example, determine out how many times 6 can go into 10. Write that number (1) into the quotient above the dividend. Then multiply 6 by 1, and subtract the result from 10. You should end up with 4.\nIf your dividend has more than three digits, keep repeating this process until you've worked through all of them. For example, if we we had started with 2506 grams of mushrooms, we'd pull the 6 down next and place it next to the four."", '1. Record the remainder. Depending on what you\'re using this division for, you may want to finish up with a quotient that\'s a whole number, with a remainder, i.e. an indication of how much is left over after you\'ve completed your division.\nIn the example, the remainder would be 4, because 6 cannot go into four, and there are no more digits to bring down.\nPlace your remainder after the quotient with a letter ""r"" before it. In the example, the answer would be expressed as ""41 r4.""\nYou would stop here if you were trying to calculate something that would not make sense to express in partial units, for example, if you were trying to determine how many cars were needed to move a certain number of people. In a case such as this, it would not be useful think about things in terms of partial cars or partial people.\nIf you plan to calculate a decimal, you can skip this step.', ""2. Add a decimal point. If you are planning to calculate a precise answer rather than one with a remainder, you'll now need to move beyond whole numbers. When you've reached a point at which you are left with a number smaller than your divisor, add a decimal point to both the quotient and the dividend.\nIn the example, since 250 is a whole number, every digit after the decimal will be 0, making it 250.000."", '3. Keep repeating. Now you have more digits that can be brought down (all of them zeroes). Bring down a zero and continue as before, determining how many times the divisor can go into the new number.\nIn the example, determine how many times 6 can go into 40. Add that number (6) to the quotient above the dividend and after the decimal point. Then multiply 6 by 6, and subtract the result from 40. You should end up with 4 again.', ""4. Stop and round. In some cases, you will find that when you start to solve for the decimal, the answer repeats over and over. At this point, it's time to stop and round your answer up (if the repeating number is 5 or greater) or down (if it is 4 or less).\nIn the example, you could keep getting 4 out of 40-36 forever, and add 6's to your quotient indefinitely. Instead of doing this, stop the problem and round the quotient. Because 6 is greater than (or equal to) 5, you would round up to 41.67.\nAlternatively, you can indicate a repeating decimal by placing a small horizontal line over the repeating digit. In the example, this would make the quotient 41.6, with a line over the 6."", ""5. Add the unit back to your answer. If you are working with units like pounds, gallons, or degrees, once you are done with all your calculations, add the unit to the end of your answer.\nIf you added a zero as a place-holder at the beginning, you should erase that now as well.\nIn the example, because you asked how much each mushroom in a 250-gram pack of 6 weighs, you'll need to put your answer into grams. Therefore, your final answer is 41.67 grams.""]"
Personal Care and Style,"[""1. Perform bodyweight squats. Stand up straight with your feet hip-width apart. Bend at your knees and slowly lower your body into a sitting position.

Then, bend your knees into 90-degree angles with your right knee in line with your ankle and your left knee pointing toward the floor. Make sure your right knee doesn't go out past your toes. Pause for 1-2 seconds, then push through your left heel to rise back to your starting position.\nDo 3 sets of 20 lunges.\nAlternate knees after every lunge or complete all of your reps for 1 leg, then switch to your other leg.Variation: Do side lunges by stepping out to the side instead of the front. Step out to the right, then bend your right knee into a 90-degree angle. Make sure your knee doesn't go out past your toes, and keep your left leg straight. Then, push through your right leg to rise back to your starting position."", '5. Do bridges to work your glutes. Lie on your back with your knees bent and your arms at your sides. Tighten your glutes and core muscles, then slowly lift your butt off the floor and toward the ceiling. Check that your body is in a straight, diagonal line from your knees down to your shoulders. Pause for 1-2 seconds, then slowly lower your butt down to the floor.\nUse your arms to help you maintain balance.\nDo 3 sets of 10 repetitions.', '6. Perform one-leg kickbacks in a downward position. Get onto your hands and knees, with your hands under your shoulders and your knees under your hips. Make sure your back is straight and your legs are bent at 90-degree angles. Lift your right leg off of the floor, keeping it at a 90-degree angle. Squeeze your glutes and raise your leg as high as you can. Then, lower your leg back to the starting position.\nTo add resistance, use ankle weights.\nDo 3 sets of 8-12 reps.Variation: Do kickbacks while standing tall with your feet hip-width apart. Lift 1 leg off the ground and kick it behind you. Tighten your glutes as you pull your leg back. Then, release your glutes as you lower your leg back to the floor.', '7. Do step ups with a knee lift to work your glutes and thighs. Stand with your back straight about 1 foot (0.30 m) in front of a sturdy box with your knees hip-width apart. Step up onto the box with your right leg. Bring your left leg up toward your chest into a knee lift, then lower it back to the floor. Step off the box and return to your starting position to complete 1 repetition.\nDo 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions on each side.', ""8. Do your butt workout 3 times a week, with a rest day in between. You can actually make your butt rounder and larger by strengthening the muscles in it, known as your glutes. While it will take time to make your butt noticeably bigger, you'll see small improvements soon after you begin exercising your glutes. During your butt workout, do squats, squats with arabesques, jump squats, lunges, bridges, one-leg kickbacks, and step ups with a knee lift. Do 3 sets of each exercise.\nThe number of repetitions in each set will vary depending on the exercise you're doing. For instance, you might do 20 lunges per set but only 10 bridges.\nRest at least 1 day between butt workouts to give your muscles time to recover and rebuild. Resting is essential for getting a bigger butt because rebuilding is what increases the size of your muscles.\nYou can do cardio exercise or work other muscle groups on your rest days.\nFor instance, you might do your butt workout on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaila Ajani\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFitness Trainer\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaila Ajani is a Fitness Trainer and founder of Push Personal Fitness, a personal training organization based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Climb stairs to build your butt while increasing your heart rate. Climbing stairs is a great way to work your entire lower body, including your glutes. Plus, it increases your heart rate, so it's a good cardio exercise. Use a stair climber machine or walk up and down flights of stairs. Keep moving for the entire duration of your workout.\nFor instance, if your goal is to do 30 minutes of cardio each day, then you'd climb the stairs continuously for 30 minutes.Variation: Run or jog up the stairs to increase the intensity of your workout."", ""2. Set your treadmill on an incline. Walking and jogging both work your rear on their own, but you'll see more noticeable results if you're working on an incline. When you're walking on an elevation, your glutes are more engaged. Raise the incline on your machine as high as you can while still maintaining proper form.\nDon't raise the platform so high that you have to hold on. It's best to pump your arms as you walk or jog to increase the workout."", ""3. Take a brisk walk or jog around a hilly area. When you walk up a hill, you're going up an elevated surface. This works your glutes, which can help improve the look of your butt. Bring your cardio workout outdoors to an area with natural hills or man-made inclines. Then, do a brisk walk or jog to raise your heart rate while also working your glutes.\nWear a weighted vest to increase the intensity of your workout.\nWalk or jog for 20-30 minutes."", '4. Play a recreational sport that builds your leg and buttocks muscles. Many sports include movements that naturally enhance your rear. Additionally, sports are a great way to meet your cardio goals. Pick a butt-boosting sport that you enjoy playing to get results while having fun. Here are some great options:\nRunning\nCycling\nSwimming\nGymnastics\nSkiing\nVolleyball\nSoccer\nField Hockey\nCheerleading', '5. Do at least 150 minutes of moderate cardio activity weekly for general health. Your body needs regular exercise to maintain good health. Do at least 30 minutes of cardio activity 5 days per week to meet your weekly exercise goals. You can do all of your exercise in a single time block, or you can break it up into 10-15 minute segments spread throughout your day.\nExamples of moderate cardio activity include a brisk walk, low impact aerobics, and swimming.\nFor instance, you might take a brisk 15-minute walk during your lunch break and again after dinner.Variation: If you prefer vigorous cardio activity like running or dancing, you only need 75 minutes per week for good health.', '1. Drink at least 11.5 cups (2,700 mL) of fluids daily to stay hydrated. Women need at least 11.5 cups (2,700 mL) of water each day, while men need at least 15.5 cups (3.7 L) of water daily. Increase your fluid intake by drinking more water, tea, smoothies, or sports drinks. Additionally, snack on fruits and veggies, which contain water.\nIf you are very active or sweat a lot, then you may need to increase your water intake.', ""2. Get 35% of your calories from lean protein to help build muscle. Choose protein sources like poultry, fish, soy, meat-replacement products, beans, legumes, nuts, and low-fat dairy. Include a protein source with every meal and snack so that your body consistently receives protein throughout the day. This will help your body rebuild its muscles.\nTo calculate how many grams of protein you need, multiply the number of calories you're eating by 35%. Then, divide by 4, which is the number of calories in a gram of protein. As an example, if you were eating 2,000 calories per day, then you'd multiply 2,000 x 35% = 700. Then, divide 700/4 = 175. You'd need 175 grams of protein per day.\nFor instance, you might eat Greek yogurt for breakfast, tuna with a salad at lunch, almonds for a snack, and grilled chicken as your dinner entree."", ""3. Make 40% of your calories complex carbohydrates (carbs). Your body uses carbs to fuel your activity, but all carbs aren't equal. Complex carbs like those found in vegetables and whole grains break down slowly, so they provide steady fuel and don't spike your blood sugar. On the other hand, simple carbs like sugar, processed grains, and baked goods spike your blood sugar and burn quickly. Get your carbs from vegetables, whole grains, and some fruits.\nTo find out how many carbs you need, multiply the number of calories you're eating by 40%, then divide by 4, which is the amount of calories in 1 gram of carbs. If you were eating 2,000 calories, you'd multiply 2,000 x 40% = 800. Then, divide 800/4 = 200. You'd need 200 grams of carbs each day.\nFor instance, you might mix oats into your yogurt, eat a salad for lunch, snack on apple slices, and eat quinoa with roasted veggies as a side dish at dinner."", ""4. Get 25% of your calories from healthy fats. Your body also needs healthy fats to maintain your health and rebuild your muscles. Add healthy fats to your diet by consuming olive oil, canola oil, almonds, pistachios, walnuts, avocado, and fatty fish, such as salmon, trout, sardines, halibut, and mackerel.\nTo find out how much fat you need daily, multiply the number of calories you eat by 25%, then divide by 9 because each gram of fat contains 9 calories. If you eat 2,000 calories per day, you'd multiply 2,000 x 25% = 500. Then, you'd divide 500/9 = 55.5. You'd need about 55 grams of fat per day.\nFor example, you could sprinkle crushed walnuts over your yogurt at breakfast, use an olive oil dressing on your salad at lunch, eat almonds as a snack, and cook your dinner using olive oil or canola oil."", ""5. Avoid processed and sweetened foods because they lack nutrients. Processed and sweetened foods and drinks are full of empty calories, so they won't help you reach your goals. Do your best to reduce or eliminate them from your diet. This will help you reach your results faster.\nFor example, avoid boxed snacks, candy, and baked goods, as well as soda and flavored coffee.\nIt's okay to eat your favorite foods in moderation, so don't feel like you have to give up all of your favorite foods."", '1. Wear butt enhancing shapewear or padding for an instant boost. Butt enhancers are easy to use and provide instant results. Purchase underwear that has built-in padding or use inserts that go into your regular panties. Try different sizes of padding to find the look you prefer. Then, wear your shapewear under your clothing whenever you want the look of a bigger bottom.\nYou may be able to buy pants with butt enhancers already sewn in. Look for jeans or leggings that have a little extra padding.\nTry making your own padding by using foam filler or batting material used to fill pillows and quilts. You can find these at your local craft store or online.', ""2. Wear tight pants with small, wide-set pockets. Your butt already looks great, it just needs the right pair of pants to show it off. This will make your butt look round and perky so it appears bigger. Choose tight, stretchy pants that fit well over your butt. Additionally, choose pockets that create the illusion that your butt is bigger, such as small, wide-set, or decorated pockets.\nSmall pockets work well because they make your butt seem bigger by comparison, and wide-set pockets work by drawing the eye out. Similarly, pockets with decorations, such as studs, jewels, or flaps, make your butt look bigger because they add a bit of bulk on your bottom.\nBaggy pants can make your butt look flatter because they don't define it."", ""3. Cinch up your waist with a belt. Wearing a belt at the narrow part of your waist can create the look of bigger curves. This is because the belt will make your waist look smaller than your hips and butt, giving the appearance that your butt is bigger. You can get this look at any size, so don't worry if you don't like your tummy. To create the effect, position your belt over your clothing at the narrow part of your waist.\nThis works best with a long top, blouse, or dress.\nIf you're slim, try a thin or medium-sized belt.\nIf you're curvier, play around with medium- to large-sized belts."", '4. Wear high heels to make your spine curve. Wearing heels is a quick and easy way to make your butt look bigger. This is because heels change the natural curve of your spine, which emphasizes your butt and boobs. Choose the highest heels that feel comfortable to you. They will instantly make your butt look bigger.\nHigher heels will create a more dramatic effect than lower heels.\nIf wearing heels is difficult for you, practice walking in them before you take them out in public.']"
Sports and Fitness,"[""1. Slap them with a swatter. A mosquito swatter, usually made of a thicker metal or plastic than a regular fly swatter, is mounted on the end of a springy wire. This dramatically increases your chances of hitting a stationary mosquito by increasing the momentum of the swat.\nAny item that will make your arm longer, and therefore your swing faster, will suffice if you don't have a swatter. Try a rolled up magazine or newspaper.\nNo swatter handy? Kill the flying mosquito with a double-handed clap. Using two hands is more effective than one, as the air coming from each hand will blow the mosquito into the opposing palm."", ""2. Wear chemical mosquito repellent. Keeping mosquitoes away from your body is the best way to avoid getting bitten. Use insect repellent on uncovered skin surfaces and on your clothing when you're outdoors, especially during the day. When using sunscreen, apply it before insect repellent.\nRepellents containing 30% to 50% DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide) are the most popular type of repellents, and are recommended for adults and children over 2 months of age and are effective for several hours. Repellents with lower amounts of DEET offer shorter-term protection and must be applied more often.\nRepellents containing up to 15% picaridin, which must be applied often, are available in the US. Picaridin is odorless, has a pleasant feel, and doesn't plasticize like DEET. Studies have shown it to be as fully repellent to mosquitoes as DEET and can also be applied on infants as young as 2 months.\nProtect infants less than 2 months of age by using a carrier draped with mosquito netting with an elastic edge for a tight fit rather using a repellent."", ""3. Use an oil-based repellent. The safety of using chemical deterrents manufactured by combining synthetic chemicals in the laboratory has been questioned, and there are many natural solutions you can use instead. Citronella oil, cinnamon oil and castor oil are reputed to keep mosquitoes away. Most natural repellents require more frequent application or use than the chemical versions.\nOil of lemon eucalyptus is sold as a product called Repel®. Repel is a 40% formulation of naturally-derived eucalyptus and has a pleasant scent and feel without any plasticizing properties. It is also effective at repelling ticks.\nTea tree oil may be another useful natural repellent. Look for commercial repellents that include it.\nTry Skin Armour Deep Woods Outdoor soap. A combined effort from the researchers in Australia and China who have worked extensively over the last decade to find a competent mosquito protection product resulted in this product. It's is a completely natural product made from a group of powerful natural oils and may help to you keep yours safe from the attack of mosquitoes while you're working or camping outdoors."", ""4. Wear loose, full coverage clothing. Long-sleeved shirts and long pants will help to protect you from mosquitoes when you're outdoors. Covering your skin is a key approach to repelling mosquitoes.\nClothing may also be sprayed with repellent containing permethrin or another EPA-registered repellent for greater protection. Do not use permethrin directly on your skin.\nAvoid wearing heavy, dark clothing in warm weather. Mosquitoes are attracted to warm bodies, so staying cool is an effective way to avoid bites. They also appear to like black, blue and red the most.\nDon't wear scent when outdoors during mosquito season. Mosquitoes are attracted to sweat, but the act of sweating can mask more effective attractors of mosquitoes, such as perfumes."", ""5. Use mosquito nets to protect yourself at night. If you're sleeping in a mosquito-infested area, get a mosquito net to drape around the bed or mat so that it touches the floor on all sides. This is the only really effective way to prevent them from getting inside to bite you, especially if there are open windows or doors in the vicinity.\nCheck the net for holes regularly; even overly long toenails can tear a hole in them during sleep.\nMake sure you are not touching the net anywhere while you sleep.\nKennels and other pet refuges should also be covered with mosquito nets when you are experiencing a mosquito infestation."", ""6. Insect-proof your home. Check your screens and repair any that have holes or tears in them that would let mosquitoes fly in. Silicon caulk or screen patches work well. Use weather stripping to seal door gaps, especially under the doors. There's no sure way to prevent mosquitoes from coming in, but taking these measures can really help."", '7. Stay indoors when mosquitoes prefer to be outside. They tend to come out at dusk, dawn and in the dark, so if you can, stay safely inside during these times. When you do go out during times when mosquitoes are most active, wear more layers to protect your exposed skin.', ""1. Use citronella products to repel them. Mosquitoes don't like to go near citronella oil. In addition to using it on your body, citronella oil can be used in the following ways to keep mosquitoes away from your property:\nBurn a citronella candle or torch. The smoke in the air may help keep away some bugs.\n\nPlant a citronella plant in a pot on your porch. To use, you can snap off a twig and rub it over your skin and around the perimeter of your porch––the smell may discourage mosquitoes.\nUse citronella incense coils. Check for the other ingredients in these and don't sit in the line of the smoke from them, as any smoke inhalation is potentially unhealthy."", '2. Burn other essential oils. Get an oil burner and use a candle to heat some water and an essential oil like lemon eucalyptus, lavender or catnip (a mixture of few oil types is preferred). The heat of the candle will evaporate the oil into the air, and both the heat and the repellent oils will help to create a 2 to 3 meter (6.6 to 9.8 ft) radius of mosquito-free zone.', ""3. Put out a dish of soapy water. If you're having an outdoor meal, you can keep mosquitoes away by placing a dish of water with some dish soap in a discreet place nearby. The mosquitoes will be attracted to the water source, and they'll get trapped in the soap bubbles and drown."", ""4. Use lighting that doesn't attract mosquitoes. Place yellow LED lights around doorways, windows and porches. Mosquitoes won't hang around if the light is sourced from yellow LEDs, bug lights or sodium lamps."", '5. Screen or cover outdoor spaces. If you live in a place with a big mosquito infestation, you might want to use a net or screen outside as well as inside. Place a suitable net or clear outdoor covering around your porch or outdoor area. A waterproof one will help to keep out the rain, the snow and all the bugs, too.', ""6. Grow some garlic in your yard. Eating garlic daily to repel mosquitoes has not been proven effective in scientific studies, but, some people believe it has an impact when used as a barrier. Since garlic is delicious, it can't hurt to grow it, but don't rely on it as the only source of repelling the pests.\nPlant garlic around your house to repel mosquitoes. It can be integrated around your house, on a balcony, etc.\nGarlic powder from your local grocer sprinkled all through your yard may create a mosquito repellent. Sprinkle a little extra thickly around the patio and porch areas. This may protect pets from being bitten if they sleep in that area."", '7. Use a mosquito trapping system. Mosquitoes can be effectively killed using a dedicated machine that employs heat and carbon dioxide to attract the mosquitoes and then entrap or kill them using nets, containers or chemicals. While these mosquito trapping systems can be expensive, they\'re quite effective, and worth looking into if you\'re committed to keeping your yard mosquito-free.\nMosquito trapping systems won\'t eliminate all of the mosquitoes from your yard. Every neighborhood tends to have more than one species of mosquito breeding in the area, and different types of trapping systems cater to different species. Ask around in your area to find out what type of trapping system has worked well for others.\nAvoid using an electric ""zapper"". These have been shown to kill many bugs very effectively, but generally the bugs killed are the non-harmful ones. Plus, the noise they generate tends to be obnoxious.', ""1. Dump or flush out any stagnant water sources in your yard. Mosquitoes are often attracted to water, especially standing water. Examples of mosquito breeding grounds include old tires, driveway puddles, clogged gutters, unfiltered fish ponds, empty flowerpots, and any item that can hold water for more than a few days at a time.\nUse a push broom to distribute the water for small puddles on hard surfaces. Use a siphon pump for larger puddles.\nIf you're inundated by mosquitoes due to standing water from street curbs, drainage ditches or other pools you cannot control, call the responsible public authority to explain that you believe the water has become a mosquito breeding source.\nIf it is not possible to remove particular water source, place some Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis (BTI) dunks/granules into the water. BTI is a species of bacteria that functions as a larvicide and will kill mosquito larvae for as long as a month, in addition to being safe and non-toxic to children/pets."", ""2. Maintain water features and swimming pools. If you have a koi pond or swimming pool that doesn't see much use, it may become a breeding ground for mosquitoes. Do yourself and your neighbors a favor by doing regular maintenance to keep the water fresh and flowing.\nCut back vegetation from around your pond or other water features.\nIf you have a birdbath or another small source of water, change the water frequently or agitate it so mosquitoes won't lay eggs there.\nTreat your pool with the proper chemicals to make it uninhabitable for mosquitoes."", '3. Keep your grass mowed regularly and trim your shrubs. Too much grass and shrubbery can create breeding and hiding grounds for mosquitoes. Be sure to regularly mow your lawn and use hedge trimmers to cut back shrubs and other vegetation.']"
Home and Garden,"['1. Prepare your potting soil in a separate bucket. Pour some soil into a large bucket and add water to it until it is damp. Mix the soil with your hand or a trowel until it is evenly damp. Do not allow the soil to become soggy, or the seeds will rot. You will need a well-draining soil. Lemon trees love water, but they hate to sit in it.\nTry to get a pasteurized soil mix. Pasteurization gets rid of any bacteria that can kill seeds.\nConsider getting a soil that is a blend of peat, perlite, vermiculite, and organic fertilizer. This will give your seedling proper drainage and nutrients.', '2. Choose a small pot with drainage holes. The pot should be about 3 to 4 inches (7.62 to 10.16 centimeters) wide, and 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.24 centimeters) deep.This pot will be enough for one seed. Some people like to plant several seeds in one pot at a time. If you want to do this too, choose a larger pot.\nYour pot must have drainage holes. If your pot does not have any, you will need to drill some.', '3. Fill the pot with soil. Stop when the top of the soil is about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) from the rim.', '4. Make a ½ inch (1.27 centimeter) deep hole in the soil. You can do this using your finger or a pencil.', ""5. Choose a plump-looking seed from a lemon. It may be necessary to use an organic lemon because seeds from a non-organic lemon may not sprout. Also, avoid taking any seeds that look too tiny (like a grain of rice) or that look shriveled (like a raisin). These seeds either won't sprout or won't grow into healthy seedlings.\nConsider planting 5 to 10 lemon seeds at one time, in case some of the seeds don't sprout or don't make it past seedling-hood.\nKeep in mind that trees that come from seeds are not identical to the parent tree that they came from. Sometimes, the fruit that the new saplings produce is of a lesser quality. Other times, they do not produce edible fruit at all. This does not prevent the young tree from being visually pleasing. Keep this in mind when growing your tree."", '6. Wash the seed to get rid of the slimy coating. You can do this by washing the lemon seed or by sucking on it until the coating is gone. This is important. The gel-like coating contains sugars, which can cause the seed to rot.\nConsider leaving the lemon seeds in a cup of warm water overnight. This will help them sprout faster.', '7. Drop the seed into the hole and cover it up. Make sure that the pointy tip is pointing downward into the soil, and the rounded part is pointing upward towards you. The roots will come out of the pointy part.', '8. Cover the pot with a piece of breathable plastic to trap warmth and moisture. Begin by placing a sheet of clear plastic cling wrap over the pot. Wrap a rubber band around the plastic wrap to secure it to the pot. Poke a few holes into the plastic wrap. You can use a pencil, a toothpick, or even a fork. These holes will allow the plant to breathe.', '9. Place the pot in a warm location. You can place the pot in a sunny location too, but sunlight is not vital at this point. In fact, too much sunlight can ""cook"" the young, delicate seedlings. You should see a sprout emerge in about two weeks.\nThe ideal temperature is between 68°F and 82.4°F (20°C and 28°C).', '10. Water the soil when you see it become dry. The plastic wrap should trap the moisture, and the condensation should rain down onto the soil, making it damp again. In very dry environments, this may not happen. If you see the soil start to become dry, remove the plastic wrap and water the plant. Be sure to re-cover the pot with the plastic wrap when you are done watering.', '11. Remove the plastic covering once the sprout appears and transfer the pot to a warm, sunny location. Remember to keep the soil damp, but do not let it become soggy. Click here to learn how to take care of your seedling.', '1. Dampen a paper towel and smooth it out on a flat surface. Start by soaking a paper towel with water, then squeeze out the excess water. Place the damp paper towel on a flat surface and smooth out any wrinkles.\nThe paper towel should fit inside your plastic zippered or resealable bag. If the paper towel is too big, then fold it in half or into quarters.', ""2. Pick out 5 to 10 plump seeds from an organic lemon. Seeds from non-organic lemons will not always sprout, so it is a good idea to prepare at least 10 seeds to ensure you have a healthy selection. Look for seeds that are large and plump. Skip the ones that look shriveled or like tiny, white specks. These will either not sprout, or they won't grow into a healthy seedling.\nEven if you only plan on growing one lemon tree, it is a good idea to start with several seeds. Not all seeds will sprout, and not all seedlings will survive.\nTake care to not crowd the seeds. They should be at least three inches apart, so that they have room for their roots as they germinate."", '3. Consider keeping the seeds in a cup of water overnight. This will keep the seeds from drying out while you work. The seeds must stay moist. If they dry out, they will not sprout.', '4. Clean the gel-like coating off of each seed. You can do this by rinsing the seeds in cool water, or by sucking on them. This gel is filled with sugars, which can encourage mold and bacteria growth.', '5. You can also peel the other white layer off to reveal a brown-colored seed. Start peeling from the pointy end. You can use your finger nail or a craft knife to nick the tip, and then peel the outer shell down. This will make it easier for the seeds to sprout and speed up the process, but is not necessary for germination to occur.', '6. Peel the brown seed cover off as well. You may notice that your seed is covered with a thin, brown film. Use your fingernail to scratch this coating off.', ""7. Place the seeds onto the damp paper towel. Try to spread the seeds out as evenly as you can, so that the roots don't become tangled when they sprout."", '8. Repeat the peeling process for the rest of the seeds and place them down onto the towel. Once the seeds are on the paper towel, they should stay damp. If you notice them starting to get dry out, consider covering the paper towel with another damp paper towel, or folding the first one overtop of them.', ""9. Slip the paper towel into a plastic zippered or resealable bag, and close the bag tightly. Don't use a plastic grocery bag. You want the bag to be zippered or resealable; this will help trap the moisture and retain heat. Your seeds will need both in order to sprout."", '10. Keep the plastic bag in a dark, warm location until the seeds sprout. Keep the temperature between 68 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit. It will take one to two weeks. Some seedlings will need up to three weeks to sprout.', '11. Transplant the seedlings when the tails are about 3.15 inches (8 centimeters) long. Make a shallow hole (a half inch deep) in a pot of damp, well-drained soil, and tuck the seedling, tail-side-down into the hole. Gently pat the soil around the seedling.', '12. Move the pot to a warm, sunny location. Remember to water the plant and to keep the soil damp; do not allow the soil to become soggy or dry. Click here to learn how to take care of your seedling.', ""1. Water your plant regularly, about 2 or 3 times per week. When the seedling has 4 developed leaves, let the surface of the soil become dry before you water again. Don't let the soil dry out completely, however; it should be moist if you stick your finger into it."", '2. Make sure that it gets enough sunlight. Lemon trees require at least eight hours of sunlight. Seedlings will require 10 to 14 hours. You may have to place a grow light next to your tree to ensure that it gets enough sunlight. You can purchase grow lights from gardening shops and nurseries.', ""3. Know when to transplant your seedling. Eventually, your seedling will outgrow its pot. When the seedling reaches 1 year old, transfer it to a 6 inch (15.24 centimeter) wide pot. Eventually, you will need to move your plant to a pot that is 12 to 18 inches (30.48 to 45.72 centimeters) wide and 10 to 16 inches (25.4 to 40.64 centimeters) deep.\nA good rule of thumb to determine when it's time to transplant is to look under the pot. If you can see roots through the drainage holes, it is time for a new, bigger pot."", '4. Maintain the soil pH level. Lemon trees like soil that is slightly acidic. The pH should be between 5.7 and 6.5. You can measure this with a pH testing kit, which you can purchase from a gardening shop or a nursery. A good way to lower the acidity of the soil is by watering the plant once a month with some cold black coffee or tea (with no milk or sugar added). However, make sure that you continue to monitor the pH until it has reached the ideal range.', '5. Remember to provide your tree with proper nutrients so that it grows healthy and strong. You can either dig a trench around the tree and fill it with dry compost, or you can water it with a water soluble fertilizer. Here are some ways in which you can provide your tree with the nutrition it needs:\nFertilize your lemon tree twice a year with an organic fertilizer, such as compost or vermicompost.\nWater your plant every 2 to 4 weeks with a water soluble fertilizer. It should be high in potassium and magnesium.\nIf your tree is going to stay indoors, purchase a general indoor plant fertilizer. It should contain micronutrients.\nWater your tree once a month with a solution made from 1 tablespoon of Epsom salts and ½ gallon (1.89 liters) of water. If your tree is still very small, you might not need so much water. Instead, water the plant as much as you need to, then save the leftover water for the next month.', ""6. Understand that it will take some time before your tree can bear fruit. Some lemon trees will produce fruit in as little as five years. Others will requires as many as 15 years.\nIf you have an indoor lemon tree, you'll also need to pollinate it by hand before it will bear fruit. Bees typically take care of this when your lemon tree is planted outside, though.""]"
Hobbies and Crafts,"[""1. Play with two people. Gin rummy is best played with only two players. But if you have a third person who wants to play, have one person act as the dealer without dealing themselves any cards. Then rotate this position around the table for each subsequent hand.\nFor four players, play two separate games. Or form teams, and after the two simultaneous games, add up your and your teammate's scores to see if together you beat your opponents' total."", ""2. Use a 52-card deck. If your deck of cards came with any Jokers, place those to the side and don't use them. Note that aces will be low in this game (i.e. worth one point), and jacks, queens, and kings are high (each worth ten points)."", '3. Draw a card to determine the dealer. Each player should draw a card, face-down from the top of the deck. The person with the lower valued card becomes the dealer. In subsequent rounds, the loser of the previous round will be the dealer.', ""4. Deal ten cards to each player. The dealer should distribute ten cards, face-down on the table, to each player. Cards should always be dealt clockwise around the table, but with only two players, you'll just alternate back and forth until you both have ten cards."", '5. Start the stock pile and the discard pile. The remaining cards left after dealing should be placed in a pile face-down on the table. This is the stock pile, and from the top of it the dealer should draw one card and place it face-up next to the stock pile. The face-up card forms the beginning of the discard pile.', ""1. Sort your cards into melds. Look at the ten cards in your hand. Sort them into any possible “melds,” which are sets or runs. A set is three or four cards of the same rank (5-5-5), and a run is three or more cards of consecutive rank in the same suit (4-5-6).\nAn example of a set is 10 of diamonds, 10 of spades, and 10 of clubs.\nAn example of a run is jack of diamonds, queen of diamonds, and king of diamonds.\nSince aces are low, they can't be in a run with a king. You can have ace-2-3, but not queen-king-ace."", ""2. Choose whether to take the card in the discard pile. If you weren't the dealer, you get to decide if you want to pick up the face-up card in the discard pile, or if you want to pass on it because it's not a helpful card for you. If you pass, the dealer can choose to pick it up.\nIf you both decline it, the non-dealer picks up the card from the top of the stock pile."", ""3. Pick up a new card. Whether you go for the card in the discard pile or the one on top of the stock pile, pick up your new card and assess whether it will help you form any melds. Look to see if you already have a couple of cards with the same numerical value, or if it suddenly connects a couple cards to form a run.\nIf you're picking up a card from the stock pile, don't let your opponent see what it is unless you're immediately placing it into the discard pile."", ""4. Discard a card you don't want. Select a card from your hand that probably won't be helpful and place it face-up in the discard pile. If a card seems like an outlier that won't match easily with your other cards, then it might be worth discarding. You can also discard whatever you just picked up from the stock pile.\nYou can't discard a card you just picked up from the discard pile in that turn. You can discard it during your next turn if you want, but you must keep it for at least one turn.\nAt the end of every turn you should still have ten cards."", ""5. Take turns picking up cards and discarding cards. Go back and forth drawing cards with your opponent and attempting to form melds with all your cards. At each turn, decide if you want the card that your opponent just placed face-up in the discard pile, or if you want to take the mystery card from the top of the stock pile.\nAs you form melds, do not place them on the table. You don't want your opponent to see your progress."", '6. End the game if only two stock cards remain. If a player takes the third to last card in the stock pile and the game is still going, then the hand is cancelled. No points are awarded to either player, and the cards must be re-dealt.', ""1. Knock if all your cards form melds. Knocking is how you end gameplay. If you reach a point when all of your cards are part of a meld and none of them are unmatched (these cards are called “deadwood”), then you've reached “gin.” Draw a card once it's your turn and place it face-down on the discard pile to signify that you're knocking.\nReaching gin earns you 25 bonus points in addition to all your opponent's deadwood points.\nYou can physically knock on the table if you want to, but the face-down discard is generally accepted as the knocking symbol."", ""2. Knock to prevent your opponent from reaching gin. If you think your opponent may reach gin before you, you can knock early to prevent them from getting those bonus points. Draw a card and discard one when it's your turn, placing the one you don't want face-down on the discard pile to end the game."", ""3. End the game only if your deadwood totals ten points or less. You can only knock if the points values for your deadwood cards total ten or less. Kings, queens, and jacks are worth 10, aces are worth 1, and all numerical cards are worth their numerical value.\nFor example, if you have a run of 3-4-5-6, a set of 9-9-9-9, and an ace and a king, you can't knock because your deadwood totals 11 points."", '4. Expose your melds to your opponent. Lay down all your cards face-up and divide them into melds on the table. Make it clear for your opponent to see your sets and runs by grouping cards within a meld closely together and also putting some space between the melds themselves.', ""5. Lay off deadwood cards onto the knocker's melds. Your opponent now has the chance to lay off their deadwood cards onto your cards to add to melds. For example, if you have three 5's, and one of their deadwood cards is a 5, they can add that to your set. Or they could add that 5 to a run of 6-7-8 or 2-3-4.\nDeadwood can not be laid off onto other deadwood. If you have two 3's that are deadwood, and your opponent has an extra 3, they can not create a new meld."", ""6. Lay off cards only if gin has not been reached. If either you or your opponent reaches “gin” and knocks, there's no laying off. This means that one player will potentially end up with a lot of deadwood, and thus a lot of deadwood points for the knocker to claim."", ""7. Subtract your deadwood points from your opponent's. Both players should now ignore any melds that have been formed – they don't contribute any points to the scoring. Add up each player's deadwood points and subtract to find the difference. Write down each player's points on a piece of paper.\nFor example, after laying off, your opponent might have two Queens left, which totals 20 points. If you have two 2's, that's 4 points. The difference between the two is 16 points.\nIf you reached gin, there's no subtraction needed. All of your opponent's deadwood points become yours (plus the 25-point bonus)."", ""8. Award the non-knocker for an undercut. If you were the knocker, and it turns out your opponent has fewer deadwood points than you, this is called an undercut. The difference between the deadwood points is awarded to them rather than you in this case, along with a 25-point undercut bonus.\nFor example, if you knock and have 9 points of deadwood, and your opponent lays off their cards and ends up with 2 points of deadwood, then they've undercut you. They're awarded the 7-point difference, plus 25 bonus points, for a total of 32 points."", ""9. Play until someone reaches 100 points. Deal the cards again and continue to play rounds until one player has reached 100 points. This player is awarded 100 bonus points for doing so. Each player then earns an additional 25 points for every round they won.\nIf one player doesn't win any rounds, this is a shutout, and the winner earns an additional 100 bonus points.\nThe player with the most points after all the tallying is the winner."", ""1. Memorize cards that are being discarded. Keep track of what cards both you and your opponent have discarded, as these will indicate what to avoid collecting. For example, if you saw two kings end up in the discard pile, then you shouldn't hold onto any kings in your hand since these will certainly become deadwood."", ""2. Memorize which cards your opponent is picking up. Get a sense for which cards your opponent is picking up from the discard pile since these will clue you into their sets and runs. If you see them picking up a couple 9's, don't discard a 9 you have in your hand or you risk helping them out."", ""3. Aim for runs over sets. Runs can be added onto at either end of the sequence. But once you reach three of a kind, sets can only be added onto in one way. And you're less likely to find that one extra card for a set than the two possible cards that can add to your run."", ""4. Knock as early as possible. You can't knock until your deadwood is down to 10 or fewer points, but as soon as you reach that threshold, it might be a good idea to knock. Waiting too long in the hopes that you'll reach gin could mean letting your opponent reach it first.""]"
Home and Garden,"[""1. Use dish soap and water. Fill a water bottle with one part dish soap and two parts water, then shake it up to mix the solution thoroughly. When you see a line of ants (or just one ant, for that matter) spray the mixture over them. They'll immediately halt and suffocate. Wipe up the dead ants with a wet cloth, and keep the spray bottle around for next time.\nSetting out shallow dishes of soapy water is another good way to kill ants. Lure them in with a trail of something sugary.\nThis method is good for killing groups of ants, but it won't take out the entire nest. If ants keep coming back, you might have to address the source of the problem.\nSoapy water is a natural insecticide that kills most insects, not just ants. Try it on roaches, too."", ""2. Try white vinegar and water. Ants really hate vinegar, and you can make a cheap, easy pesticide just using vinegar and water. Mix a 50/50 solution of vinegar and water in a spray bottle. Spray it directly onto the ants to kill them, then wipe up the ants using a damp paper towel and discard them.\nYou can also use vinegar and water as a deterrent; spray it around your windowsills, doorways and other places where you see ants coming inside.\nSome people have found that using this vinegar solution to clean the floors, windows and countertops makes ants less likely to crawl over these surfaces. White vinegar makes an excellent household cleaner, and you can't smell it once it dries."", ""3. Make a lemon juice solution. If you can't stand the smell of vinegar, spray the ants with a lemon juice solution. They're averse to the citric acid in lemon juice, so you can use this spray as a deterrent as well by spraying it around the perimeter of your house. Mix up a solution of 1 part lemon juice to 3 parts water and use it as an all-purpose spray."", ""4. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth inside the house. Food-grade diatomaceous earth is a very effective insecticide that doesn't harm humans or pets in the least. It's composed of fossilized diatoms that have been ground to a powder. When insects walk over the powder, the tiny fossil shards scratch the waxy outer coating on their exoskeletons, causing their bodies to dry out. Sprinkle the powder along your baseboards, windowsills, and around the perimeter of your house to kill ants. Use an applicator or a dusting bulb to do this.\nIt's recommended that you wear a mask or cloth over your face when handling diatomaceous earth. While the powder isn't harmful when ingested, the tiny particles can be hard on your lungs when you breathe them in.\nDiatomaceous earth becomes ineffective when it gets wet, or even when the air is damp and humid. It will regain its effectiveness when dry, so if your home's humidity is reducing the potency of your DE consider using a dehumidifier in the problem areas."", ""5. Use boric acid. It's completely natural and it really works against ants. When they ingest boric acid, it poisons their stomachs and they die. Boric acid also damages ants' exoskeletons the same way diatomaceous earth does. It comes in the form of a white or blue powder that you distribute with a dusting bulb in areas where you commonly see ants, like near your baseboards or in your windowsills.\nBoric acid is not a toxic pesticide, but it should not be consumed by humans or pets. Avoid using it in areas where your children and pets play. Don't use it near food sources or in your kitchen cabinets. While it should not cause harm to your pets, it may be toxic to smaller animals like birds, reptiles, and fish.\nBoric acid is toxic to beneficial insects as well."", ""1. Make boric acid sugar traps. These are easy to put together, inexpensive, and best of all, extremely effective. All you need is a few pieces of cardboard or index cards (one for each trap), a bottle of corn syrup or any type of sticky sugar substance, and boric acid powder. Here's how to make the traps:\nMix 2 tablespoons of corn syrup and 2 tablespoons of boric acid in a small bowl.\nMake sure the texture is paste-like and sticky, not runny. Add more boric acid if it's too wet.\nUse a spoon to spread the mixture over the surface of your cardboard pieces. Each piece is its own trap."", ""2. Set the traps where you tend to see ants. If they like to collect on your bathroom floor, put one there. Put one under the kitchen sink, and another on your front porch. Set the traps around wherever you see ants gathering. \nSince the traps contain boric acid, don't put them in your kitchen cabinets or near food sources.\nYou can put the traps outside, too. Place them in your flower beds or near your trash cans.\nThe sugary smell might attract critters other than ants, like your child or dog. Make sure to put the traps out of reach of kids and pets."", ""3. Wait for the traps to attract ants. If you have an infestation, it won't be long before the traps become full of ants who wander onto the cardboard in search of sugary food and feast on the boric acid-tainted syrup. They won't die just yet, but the poison will soon take action in their stomachs. In the meantime, they'll return to their nest to bring some food back for their fellow ants, which will in turn ingest the poison. \nWhen you see ants entering and leaving the traps, let them move around freely. If you kill them, they won't get the chance to bring the poison back to the nest, killing dozens more ants.\nThis method won't necessarily kill the entire nest of ants, but it will significantly reduce the population of ants around your home."", ""4. Change out the traps when the syrup dries. After a few days, you'll probably need to set out fresh traps. Mix up a fresh batch of the ant poison, spread it on pieces of cardboard, and set out the traps."", '5. Keep using the traps until ants no longer come to them. After a week or two, you should see the number of ants coming to feed on the syrup decline dramatically. When you start to see dead ants around the vicinity of the traps, and you no longer witness hordes of ants marching into the house your work is done.', ""6. Use cornmeal borax traps to kill the larvae.  Worker ants eat liquids, not solids, but they'll carry cornmeal pieces back to their nest.  They'll feed the solid pieces to larvae, which then convert the food into liquid and feed it back to the worker ants. In this way, the boric acid cycles through several generations of ants. \nMake sure the dishes of cornmeal and borax are low enough to ants to get in and out.\nYou can also make a dry paste with cornmeal, borax, and a few drops of water. Spread the paste in areas where you tend to see ants."", ""1. Follow ants to track down the nest. If ants keep swarming your house no matter what sprays and traps you employ, you'll need to attack them at their source: the nest. When you see a trail of ants marching inside, follow it as far as you can to find the anthill. Depending on the species of ant you're dealing with, the nest may be out in the open, hidden carefully in rocks or hedges, or inside your house. \n\nLittle black ants are one of the most common home invaders. These ants walk in long, slow lines, giving away their nest sites to anyone with the good sense to follow them outside. You'll find their nests in sheltered spots around the yard.\n\nOdorous house ants (known for the rotten coconut smell they emit when you crush them) build nests inside the house in window frames or inside the walls. They also build nest outdoors in woodpiles, mulch piles, under rocks, and in other outdoor crevices.\n\nPavement ants tend to nest in cracks in the sidewalk or driveway. You might not be able to see the nest itself, since it could be hidden under the pavement, but you should be able to find the ants' entryway.\n\nFire ants usually don't come inside the house, but you might have a nest on your property that's preventing you from walking around your yard in bare feet. Look for a large mound raised above the ground and composed of sand-like granules."", ""2. Prepare a pot of boiling water. Fill a large pot halfway to the top with water. Bring it to a rolling boil over high heat. As soon as the water comes to a boil, and while it's still piping hot, you'll need to be able to get it from the kitchen to the nest you found."", ""3. Pour the water over the nest. Try to pour it into the entry hole you found. The boiling water will kill hundreds of ants on contact, and it will also cause the nest to collapse. If the nest is quite large, you might want to pour more than one pot of water over it.\nIf the nest you're dealing with is indoors, the boiling water trick might damage your house. Instead of using water, douse the nest with a bowl of soapy water. You can also put on a pair of long rubber gloves and scrape the nest into a bucket, then drown the ants.\nIf you're dealing with fire ants, make sure you approach the nest wearing long pants tucked into socks and long sleeves. The ants are sure to get angry, and they may swarm out of the nest and attempt to climb into your clothes."", '4. Check for ants over the next few days. If the boiling water effectively killed them, your ant-enduring days should be over. If you see a slow trickle coming back, give the nest another boiling water treatment. Sometimes it takes more than one application to effectively kill all of the ants. \nIf the boiling water doesn\'t seem to be doing the trick, take a stake and stab it down into the nest. Wiggle it around until you have a fair-sized crater. Fill the crater with baking soda about halfway up and pour vinegar over it.\nIf you\'re trying to kill red ants, you can also try what is known as ""bucketing."" Wearing pants tucked into long socks for protection, take a shovel and quickly shovel the fire ant mound into a large bucket that has been sprinkled with baking soda, which keeps the ants from climbing out. Keep going until the whole nest has been shoveled out. Drown the ants in vinegar and water or with boiling water.', ""5. Plug the entrance holes if you can't get to the nest. Sometimes it's difficult to access the entire nest, but you can usually find an entrance hole. You can pour boiling water into the entrance hole, but it's often just as effective to simply plug the hole. Fill it up with dirt or rocks, and sprinkle some boric acid around the site for good measure. The ants will likely relocate their nest."", ""1. Make a line that ants won't cross. There are several natural substances that ants abhor so much, they won't go near them. If you use one of these substances to create lines around your windowsills, around the perimeter of your house, and in any spots where ants are getting inside, you can keep ants from coming inside. Freshen up the lines every few days, since ants will be able to get through once the lines are broken. Here are substances that work for this purpose:\nCinnamon\nCayenne pepper\nGround orange or lemon peels\nCoffee grounds"", '2. Squirt lemon juice along outdoor edges. This will keep the inside of your house from getting sticky, but the ants will be deterred by a strong citrus smell. You can also squirt a solution of half lemon juice, half water around the outside of your house.', ""3. Use essential oils to keep ants away. They hate the smell of a variety of essential oils, many of which smell very pleasant to humans. Add 10 drops of essential oil to 1 cup of water, then spray the solution both indoors and outdoors to keep ants away. Here are the oils you can try:\nLemon oil\nPeppermint oil\nEucalyptus oil (don't use this near cats! It's toxic to them, but not to dogs)\nLavender oil\nCedar oil"", ""4. Keep your surfaces clean so ants aren't interested in coming in. During the spring months, when ants are most likely to come inside the house, do your best to keep your floors, countertops, and cabinets spotless. This goes a long way toward keeping ants out. If they don't smell food, they won't be interested in invading your house. \nKeep food containers tightly sealed, too. This is especially important for sugar, honey, syrup and other foods that ants like to eat.\nClean up spills right away, especially fruit juice or syrup spills."", ""5. Seal your house to keep them out. If you don't give ants a door inside, they'll be more likely to stick to outdoor areas. Find all the little cracks and crevices where they could be getting in, like under the door, around the windowsills, and in other little cracks in the foundation. Fill the holes with caulk or other sealants to keep your house airtight. Spritz the areas with lavender or lemon water for good measure.""]"
Personal Care and Style,"[""1. Use alcohol and alcohol-based products to peel away polish. The stronger the alcohol content the better this will work. Of course, your first move should be to use isopropyl alcohol, also known as rubbing alcohol, but there are other products that contain alcohol (or ethyl glycol) in them. If you see this listed as an ingredient on a product in your home, that product may be effective in removing nail polish:\nPerfume\nHair-spray\nHand sanitizer\nSpray-on deodorant\nRubbing alcoholWhile alcoholic spirits shouldn't be your first option, clear, high-alcohol drinks like vodka, grappa, or gin will all battle nail polish. You may have to soak your nails for 10-20 minutes in the liquor for the best effects."", '2. Use white vinegar, or a vinegar solution mixed with lemon juice, to fight nail polish. Vinegar is an acid and all-purpose, all-natural cleaner around the house. So it makes sense that it could be used to strip away nail polish. For added effect, squeeze in half a lemon, or even some orange juice, to get powerful citrus cleaning power as well.\nSoak your fingers for 10-15 minutes before trying to remove. however, do not  pick away the polish with your other nails as it can weaken them.', '3. Use some basic toothpaste to scrub away polish. A dollop of toothpaste is all you need. Then start scrubbing with an old toothbrush or a paper towel. In general, white toothpastes work best as they lift and pull the color off your nail.\nFurthermore, toothpaste with baking soda, a well-known natural cleaning solution, often has the best results.', '4. Mix two parts hydrogen peroxide with one part hot water and soak for 10 minutes. This means that, if you use roughly one cup of hot water, you use two cups of hydrogen peroxide. Soak in the hottest water you can find, lightly working the nails with your free fingers, then file the polish off with a nail file.', '5. Use a powerful solvent or paint remover alternatively, though it is not recommended. This is not a solution for every day, as these chemicals can be dangerous. That said, they will work to remove nail polish, often just as fast as nail polish remover would. The following products should be a last resort, and should be applied in a well-ventilated area:\nAcetone\nPaint thinner\nFluid Thinner', ""1. Apply your chosen product with a cotton ball. Once you've found a product that can act as nail polish remover, soak a cotton ball or paper towel in that product. Then, gently dab onto your nails on each hand. Add more product to the cotton ball or paper towel as needed. If the cotton ball of paper towel becomes saturated with color, replace it."", ""2. Let the product sit for a minute. As you're not using conventional nail polish remover, you'll need to let the product sink in. Leave the product resting on your nails for about a minute.\nThe longer you let the product sit, the better.\nIf you've tried this already, or need stronger remover, soak your nails directly in the solution for 4-5 minutes beforehand, then continue from this step."", '3. Wipe the product off your nails, scrubbing to remove polish. After the product has been sitting for a minute, wipe your nails dry. Once again, use a cotton pad or paper towel. It may take a bit more effort than would be needed with regular nail polish. Thicker or glittery nail polishes may take longer to remove. You may have to repeat the process if not all the polish is removed the first time.\nAn old toothbrush can aid in scrubbing.\nPaper towels are generally sturdier than cotton balls, and may help get rid of some tougher polishes.', '4. Soak your hand in hot water, rubbing and chipping at the polish, and try again. Hot water will loosen the polish, allowing you to get another nail under it and remove chunks of polish. This is great for finishing up any last bits or weakening the polish for another round of DIY remover.\nGet the water as hot as you can tolerate without burning yourself for best results.\nYou may need to soak for 20-25 minutes, so put it in while watching some TV and then wipe when the show is over. Reheat water when necessary.', ""1. Select another nail polish that will not dry too quickly. Nail polish dries due evaporation of the solvents it contains. Applying the second coat effectively softens these same solvents. This allows the polish to return to a liquid state and be wiped away. The best type of polish for this method is thin and slow to dry. A clear top coat would work, as they tend to dry slowly. Avoid quick dry nail polishes or sprays or drops that cause nails to dry faster.\nSome blogs suggest that darker colors than the polish you're removing often have the best effects. That said, the rate at which a polish dries is the most important factor. It should be slow."", '2. Apply the polish to one nail at a time. Paint the nail, covering the old polish. You do not need to take as much time applying the polish as you normally would as you are going to wipe it off anyway. Do not allow the new polish to dry. If it dries on, the nail polish will be even more difficult to remove which will take even longer.', '3. Wipe the new polish off quickly. Immediately after adding new polish, wipe off the old nail polish. For the best results, use a paper towel.\nWhile many people typically use cotton balls when using nail polish remover, you should avoid cotton balls when using this method. They are likely to break apart or get stuck to the wet polish, leaving the polish stuck on.\nYou may have to apply some force for the best effect. While using a second layer of nail polish is effective, it may require slightly more effort than using normal remover to wipe up the old paint', '4. Repeat painting and wiping until your nails are free of polish. This method may take a few tries before it works correctly. Keep adding another layer of nail polish and rubbing it off. It may take two or three rounds before polish is fully removed. Difficult to remove polishes, like glitter-based polishes, will require more care.\nThis method is often a good start, removing the main chunks of paint. You can then use the DIY methods above to finish removing the paint.', '1. Make a base coat with glue and water. If you struggle to remove nail polish due to a preference for glittery polishes, there is a way to take preventative measures to make removal easier. This method must be done before you paint your nails but can be a great way to avoid nail polish removal problems down the road. You make a mixture of glue and water that you apply prior to glittery nails.\nYou will need white elementary school glue, an empty nail polish bottle, and water. Fill the bottle with about a third of the way with glue. Then add water and swirl around until the mixture is thin enough to be spread on your nails.', '2. Apply and dry the glue base coat before putting on polish. Paint your nails with one layer of the glue base coat before adding your polish. Wait about five minutes for it to dry thoroughly before applying the next coat. If you normally use another kind of base coat, such as one to prevent staining, apply that after your glue base coat.', '3. Apply nail polish. When you are done with your glue-based coat and any other base coats you use, apply your glittery nail polish as you normally would. The glue has hardened on the nail, and the polish hardens on the glue. Luckily, the glue comes off of your nail easily with some force, making it much easier to remove.', ""4. Soak your nails when you're ready to remove your polish. Place your nails in warm soapy water for a few minutes. You can also run your fingers under a tap while lathering with soap. This will soften the polish so that it is much easier to remove without damaging your nails."", ""5. Peel off your old nail polish. You can peel off the nail polish using your fingers. However, you can also use a cuticle pusher, a toothpick, or some other thin, blunt object if you're having trouble doing so. Gently push it under the nail polish at the base of your nail until the old polish slides off. It should be easy to pop off completely all in one sheet.""]"
Personal Care and Style,"['1. Gather your supplies. Applying castor oil to hair seems like it might be simple, but there are a few things you can do to make it more effective and easier to apply. Here is a list of what you will need:\nCastor oil\nOther oil (argan, avocado, coconut, jojoba, sweet almond, etc.)\nHot water\nBowl\nJar\nShower cap\nTowel\nOld shirt (recommended)', '2. Dilute the castor oil with another oil. Castor oil is fairly thick. Mixing it with another oil can make it a little easier to apply. Try using one part castor oil and one part of another oil, such as argan, avocado, coconut, jojoba, or sweet almond. All of these oils are great for hair. You can also try the following combination:\n3 tablespoons (44 ml) castor oil\n1 tablespoon (15 ml) jojoba oil\n1 tablespoon (15 ml) coconut oil', '3. Consider adding a few drops of essential oil to mask the smell. Castor oil can smell bad. If this bothers you, try adding in two to three drops of a fresh-smelling essential oil, such as rosemary, peppermint, or tea tree.', '4. Pour all of the oils into a small jar and shake the jar to mix everything together. Close the lid tightly, and shake the jar for a few minutes. When you are done, take the lid off.', '5. Fill a bowl with very hot water. You can do a “hot oil treatment” with castor oil by warming it in hot water before use. Warming the oil will make it more effective and easier to work with. Make sure that the bowl you choose is large enough for the jar of castor oil to fit inside. Do not attempt to warm the oil in the microwave.', '6. Put the jar into the water, and leave it there for two to four minutes. Make sure that the water level is at the same level as the oil. Also, make sure that the no water gets inside the jar, or the oil will get wet.', '7. Once the oil is warm, pour it into a small bowl. This will make it easier for you to dip your fingers into when you go to apply it.\nConsider pouring the oil into a small bottle with an eye dropper. This way, you can use the eye dropper to just drip the oil to your scalp.\nIf you don’t have an eye dropper, you can use a bottle with a nozzle. You can get empty applicator bottles from most beauty supply stores.', '1. Dampen your hair if you wish. Although you can apply castor oil to dry hair, dampening your hair may help the oil absorb better. A quick way to dampen your hair is to fill a spray bottle with water, and spray just your scalp. Your hair should just be a little damp, not dripping wet.', '2. Cover your shoulders with a towel. This will protect your clothes from getting covered in oil. It may also be a good idea to wear something you do not care about anymore, in case the oil drips past the towel. This way you can avoid getting oil stains on your good clothes.', '3. Dip your fingers into the oil, and massage your scalp for three to five minutes. Do not use too much oil; a little bit goes a long way. Use your fingers to spread the oil between your hair roots and across your scalp. Massage your head with your fingertips using small, circular motions.\nYou can also use an eye dropper to drip the oil onto various points on your scalp. This may be easier for you, and less messy. Be sure to massage the oil into your scalp for about five minutes.', '4. Apply the oil to the rest of your hair. Scoop a little bit more oil onto your fingers, and rub it between your palms. Then, run your hands across your hair. Use your fingers to comb your hair; this helps distribute the oil. Again, start with a small amount. You do not need a lot of oil.', '5. Cover your hair with a shower cap. Loosely pile your hair on top of your head. If you need to, you can keep it in place with a claw clip. Slip a shower cap over your hair. The shower cap will trap the heat inside, and it will keep your hair from drying out.', '6. Wrap a hot towel around your head and the shower cap. Warm up a towel by soaking it with very hot water. Twist the towel to get any excess water out, then wrap it around your head. You can tuck the end of the towel in under your ""turban,"" or you can secure it with a large hair clip. The heat from the towel will make the oil more effective.\nThis technique is similar to a hot oil hair treatment, but does not involve using a hair dryer.', '7. Wait 30 minutes to 3 hours before washing the oil out. You can also leave it on overnight, although there is little evidence that shows this is more effective. When you go to wash your hair, know that it may take a while before you get all the oil out. Some people find that washing with just conditioner, and skipping the shampoo, is more effective than using shampoo.\nIf your hair doesn’t feel overly oily or heavy after the treatment, you may choose to leave the oil in instead of washing it out.', '8. Use this treatment once to twice a week for best results. Keep in mind, however, that you may not see any results the next day. Try using the castor oil treatment for four weeks before moving on to something else. You will probably start seeing results after about a month of use.\nIf you wish, you can use castor oil daily, or as often as needed.']"
Health,"[""1. Soak your foot in warm water. Use a large bowl or your bathtub to soak your foot. This will help reduce swelling and tenderness. Soak it for about 15 minutes. Repeat 3-4 times per day.\nAdd Epsom salts to the water. Epsom salts are widely recognized for their ability to reduce pain and swelling. These will also help soften the toenail. Add 1 cup of Epsom salts to a bathtub filled with a few inches of water or a foot bath.\nIf you don't have Epsom salts, you can use plain salt. Salt water will help reduce the growth of bacteria in the area.\nGently massage the affected area. This will help water soak into the ingrown toenail, which will help clear out bacteria and may relieve swelling and pain."", '2. Use cotton or floss to gently lift the nail edge. After you soak your foot, the toenail should be softened. Carefully work a piece of clean dental floss under the edge of your nail. Lift up the edge of the toenail gently so that it does not grow further into your skin.\nTry this approach after every foot soak. Use a clean length of floss each time.\nDepending on the extent of your ingrown toenail, this might be a little painful. Try taking a pain reliever to ease your discomfort.\nDon’t dig too much into your toenail. You can cause more infection, which may require medical intervention.', '3. Take a pain reliever. An over-the-counter pain reliever can give you some relief from the discomfort you’re experiencing. Try a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin. NSAIDs can help relieve pain and inflammation.\nIf you cannot take NSAIDs, try acetaminophen instead.', '4. Try a topical antibiotic cream. An antibiotic cream will help fight off infection. This type of cream is readily available at drug stores and grocery stores.\nAntibiotic creams also can have topical anesthetic such as lidocaine. This will temporarily relieve the pain in the area.\nFollow application instructions on the cream’s package.', '5. Bandage your toe to protect it. To protect your toe from getting further infected or caught on your sock, wrap a bandage or bit of gauze around your toe.', '6. Wear open-toe sandals or loose shoes. Give your feet some extra room by choosing to wear open-toe shoes, sandals or other loose-fitting shoes.\nTightly fitting shoes can cause or exacerbate an ingrown toenail.', '7. Try homeopathic remedies. Homeopathy is alternative medicine that relies on herbs and other natural ingredients to treat various ailments.To treat ingrown toenail pain, try one or more of the following homeopathic remedies:\nSilicea Terra, Teucrium, Nitric Acid, Graphites, Magnetis Polus Australis, Phosphoric Acid, Thuja, Causticum, Natrum Mur, Alumina, or Kali Carb.', '1. Soak your feet for 15 minutes. Using warm water and Epsom salts, give your affected toenail a good soak for 15 minutes. This will help soften the nail, making it easier for you to pull it away from the skin.', '2. Lift the toenail away from the skin. Gently pull away the skin alongside your toenail. This will help separate the skin from the nail so that you can see the edge of the nail. Use a piece of floss or a pointed file to lift the edge of the toenail away from the skin. You might need to start with the side of the toenail that is not ingrown. Work the floss or file toward the ingrown edge.\nMake sure to disinfect the file with alcohol or hydrogen peroxide before you use it.', '3. Disinfect your toe. While you have the nail lifted away from the skin, pour a small amount of clean water, rubbing alcohol, or other disinfectant underneath the nail. This will prevent bacteria from collecting there.', '4. Pack gauze underneath the nail edge. Take a small amount of clean gauze and stuff it underneath the lifted nail. The point here is to keep the nail edge from touching the skin. Then it can grow away from the skin, rather than becoming more ingrown.', '5. Dab antibiotic cream around the nail. Once you have gauze in place, dab the area with an antibiotic cream. You can choose an ointment with lidocaine, which will slightly numb the area.', '6. Bandage the toe. Wrap a strip of gauze around your toe. Or, you can use a bandage or a toe sock, which is a single toe covering designed to keep one toe separate from the others.', '7. Repeat the process daily. Use this process to help heal an ingrown toenail. As the toe heals, the pain from the ingrown toenail will subside, and the swelling will go down.\nBe sure to change the gauze daily to ensure that bacteria is not introduced into the toenail area.', '1. Get medical attention after 2-3 days. If your home treatments are not making your toenail any better after 2-3 days, check in with your doctor. If you have diabetes or another condition that causes nerve damage, see your doctor immediately and consider seeing a podiatrist.\nIf you notice red streaks coming from the toe, you need to see a doctor immediately. This is a sign of a major infection.\nYou should also see a doctor if there is pus present near the toenail.', '2. Talk to your doctor about your symptoms. Your doctor will ask you when the ingrown toenail started, and when it started to swell or get red or painful. He or she will also likely ask you if you are feeling any other symptoms, such as fever. Be sure to talk about your symptoms fully.\nYour general practitioner is usually able to treat an ingrown toenail. But for more complicated cases or recurrent conditions, you might choose to see a podiatrist (foot specialist).', '3. Get a prescription for antibiotics. If your toenail is infected, your doctor may prescribe an oral or topical antibiotic. This will ensure that the infection clears up and new bacteria does not take root under the toenail.', '4. Allow your doctor to try lifting the toenail. Your doctor will likely want to try the least invasive procedure, which is to lift the toenail slightly away from the skin. If they can get the toenail edge away from the skin, they may pack gauze or cotton underneath.\nYour doctor will give you instructions for replacing the gauze every day. Follow these instructions to make sure your toenail heals.', '5. Ask about partial nail removal. If the ingrown toenail is very infected or has grown significantly into the surrounding skin, your doctor might opt to remove part of the nail. Your doctor will administer a local anesthetic. Then the doctor will cut along the nail edge to remove the part of the nail growing into the skin.\nYour toenail will regrow in 2-4 months. Some patients worry about the look of the toenail after this procedure. But if your toenail has been growing into your skin, chances are it will look better after this partial removal.\nToenail removal may sound drastic, but it actually relieves the pressure, irritation, and pain of an ingrown nail.', '6. Look into permanent partial nail removal. When you get repeated ingrown toenails, you might want to look into a more permanent solution. In this procedure, the doctor will remove some of your nail, along with the nail bed underneath this section. This will prevent the nail from growing back in this area.\nThis procedure is administered by laser, chemical, electrical current or other surgery.', '1. Trim your toenails properly. Many ingrown toenails are caused by improperly trimmed toenails. Cut your toenails straight across. Do not round the corners.\nUse sanitized nail clippers.\nDon’t cut your toenails too short. You can also opt to leave the toenail a little longer. This will ensure that the toenail won’t grow into the skin.', '2. Visit a foot care clinic. If you are unable to reach your toenails to clip them yourself, you can visit a foot care clinic to get this service. Check with your local hospital or health care center to find a place that will trim your toenails regularly for you.', '3. Avoid wearing tight-fitting shoes. If your shoes pinch your toes, you may put yourself at risk to develop ingrown toenails. The side of your shoe might press against your toe and cause your toenail to grow improperly.', '4. Protect your feet. If you engage in activities that could potentially injure your toes or feet, wear protective shoes. For example, wear steel-toed shoes on construction sites.', '5. Get help with toenail care if you have diabetes. People with diabetes often have numbness in their feet. If you trim your own toenails, you may accidentally cut your toe and not feel it. Visit a foot care clinic or have someone else trim your toenails for you.\nYou should also see your podiatrist regularly if you have diabetes or another condition that causes nerve damage.', '1. Check to see if there is swelling on your toe. An ingrown toenail will usually cause a small amount of swelling in the area next to your toenail. Compare your toe to the same toe on your other foot. Does it look puffier than normal?', '2. Feel the area for pain or sensitivity. The skin around the toenail will feel tender, or painful when touched or pressed. Gently press your finger along the area to isolate where the discomfort is coming from or just take a nail clipper and cut off the nail.\nAn ingrown toenail might also have a small amount of pus.', '3. Check where the nail is. With an ingrown toenail, the skin alongside the edge of the nail appears to grow over the nail. Or, the nail might look like it’s growing underneath the skin alongside the nail. You might not be able to locate the top corner of the nail.', '4. Take into account your health conditions. Most of the time, an ingrown toenail can be treated at home successfully. But if you have diabetes or another condition that causes neuropathy, or nerve damage, you should not try treating an ingrown toenail by yourself. You should make an appointment with your doctor immediately.\nIf you have nerve damage or poor blood circulation in your leg or foot, your doctor will want to check out your ingrown toenail right away.', '5. Talk with your doctor. If you’re not sure if you have an ingrown toenail, it’s best to see your doctor. She will be able to diagnose the toenail and give you recommendations for treating it.\nIf the condition is particularly bad, your physician may recommend seeing a podiatrist, or foot specialist.', '6. Don’t let your toe get worse. If you think that your toenail is ingrown, you should start treating it immediately. Otherwise, you risk letting it cause more serious problems like infection.\nIf you have symptoms for more than 2-3 days, you should see a doctor.']"
Education and Communications,"['1. Observe that some words are pronounced as written.  The word ""herb"" should be pronounced with an H sound. The word ""been"" is pronounced ""bean"", rather than ""bin"" or ""ben"". For RP, ""Again"" and ""renaissance"" are pronounced like ""a gain"" and ""run nay seance"", with the ""ai"" as in ""pain"", not ""said."" The words ending in ""body"" are pronounced as written, like ""any body"", not ""any buddy."" But use a British short O sound.', '2. Observe that H is not always pronounced. The ""H"" is pronounced in the word ""herb,"" in contrast erb. However, in many British accents, the H at the beginning of a word is often omitted, such as in many Northern accents and the Cockney accent.', '3. Say ""bean,"" not ""bin"" for the word been. In an American accent, this is often pronounced been. In an English accent, been is a common pronunciation, but ""bin"" is more often heard in casual speech where the word isn\'t particularly stressed.', '4. Notice that two or more vowels together may prompt an extra syllable. For example, the word ""road"" would usually be pronounced rohd, but in Wales and with some people in Northern Ireland it might be pronounced ro.ord.  Some speakers may even say ""reh-uud.""', '1. Listen to the ""music"" of the language. All accents and dialects have their own musicality. Pay attention to the tones and emphasis of British speakers. Sir Johnathan Ive is a good example, listen to his accent at Apple revealings. Do sentences generally end on a higher note, the same, or lower? How much variation is there in tone throughout a typical sentence? There is a huge variation between regions with tonality. British speech, especially RP, usually varies much less within a sentence than American English, and the general tendency is to go down slightly towards the end of a phrase. However, Liverpool and north-east England are notable exceptions!\nFor example, instead of saying, ""is he going to the STORE?"" Say, ""is he GOING to the store?"" Have the question descending in tone as opposed to ascending in tone (going up in tone is more common in American or Australian English).', '2. Get a British person to say well known sentences: ""How now brown cow"" and ""The rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain"" and pay close attention. Rounded mouth vowels in words such as ""about"" in London, are usually flattened in Northern Ireland.', ""3. Immerse yourself in the British culture; this means surround yourself with individuals that speak, live, walk and talk British English.  It's the surest way to learn a British accent quickly. Soon, you'll find yourself naturally able to speak with the variations above. Anything with a British speaker will work—try listening to the BBC (which provides free radio and television newscasts on the web), songs with British singers, or movies with British characters.""]"
Relationships,"[""1. Make eye contact. Eye contact is the best and easiest thing you can do to start flirting. You can look deeply into the person's eyes while also taking the time to break eye contact to keep things from getting too intense. Consider using it in these ways:\nGet caught looking. Don't stare, but do throw small glances at someone. Keep doing it until he or she catches you. Hold the gaze for a second, smile, and look away.\nLook into his or her eyes when you talk, particularly at meaningful points in the conversation (for example, while you're paying a compliment).\nWink or raise your eyebrows at your crush. It's cheesy, but it works if used sparingly. Do it when you're looking at someone from across a room, or if you're talking in a group and say something really meant for him or her.\nGirls can try looking at a guy, lowering your gaze, and looking up at the guy again through lowered lashes."", ""2. Smile. You'll probably smile automatically if you're talking to someone you like, but you can use your pearly whites to your advantage before the conversation even starts. You can even smile at the person when you pass him or her by in the halls, or just from across the room. You don't have to grin from ear to ear, either; just a simple, subtle smile will do the trick. Try these variations:\nSmile slowly. If you're looking at someone but not talking to them, try letting a slow smile spread over your face instead of breaking into an insta-grin. Slow, languid smiles are generally considered sexy.\nSmile when you make eye contact. If you're suddenly looking into someone's eyes, toss in a smile for extra appeal. (If it's a genuine smile, the other person will see it without even looking at your mouth — it will crinkle your eyes, and is known as a Duchenne smile.)\nTry smiling with your eyes, not just your mouth. Make your whole face light up when you smile."", '3. Start talking. Introduce yourself — or maintain the mystery (optional). If you don\'t already know the person you\'re flirting with, an introduction (or lack of one) can be a great thing to build flirting around. Avoid the urge to have a cheesy pick-up line. Saying ""Hi"" followed by an introduction or a simple question is much more effective and less forced.\nIf your crush doesn\'t know your name and you\'re a naturally gregarious person, try introducing yourself at some point. It can be as simple as, ""Hi, I\'m [name].  And you are...?""  Make sure you get the other person\'s name.  To help yourself remember it, try repeating it after he or she says it to you. (Such as ""Lily.  I love that name."")\nOr, if you want to make yourself seem like a bit of a challenge, work to keep your identity a mystery for a little while.  If the other person really wants to know, he or she will ask around or keep pursuing you.\nIf the person you are interested speaks in another language like Spanish, pick up a few words of the language before you strike a conversation.', '4. Initiate a conversation. Whether you already know the other person or not, a conversation is the best way to move the flirtation forward. The person you\'re flirting with will be impressed by your boldness and confidence. Here are a few guidelines:\nTalk to someone you don\'t already know. Perhaps the best way to strike up a conversation is to start with an observation which ends with a question: ""I can\'t believe how much it\'s rained this week"" or ""This place sure is packed, eh?""  What you say isn\'t important — you are simply inviting the person to talk with you.\nFind common ground with someone you do know.  If you\'ve already met the other person, strike up a conversation based on a shared experience or interest.  For instance, you might talk about a class you\'re taking together, or the train you both take to work.  Again, the topic itself doesn\'t matter — what matters is that you\'re inviting him or her to interact with you.\nGauge the response. If the person responds pleasantly, continue the conversation. If the person doesn\'t respond or seems preoccupied or disinterested, he or she probably isn\'t interested in flirting with you.', ""5. Keep it light. Don't bring up anything too personal when you're talking. Talk about the environment around you, the show you just saw, etc. Keep personal information (such as religion, money, relationships, education, and so on) out of it, unless the person enjoys intellectual debates without becoming over-emotional. Generally, it's best to avoid debating topics personally relevant to either of you (such as either yours or their religion) and to rather discuss topics you both don't have a personal stake in.\nIt's easier to flirt when you're talking about more fun and lighthearted topics, such as your pets, reality television, or your favorite vacation spots. This doesn't mean you have to dumb yourself down to flirt, but it does mean you have to relax and avoid the deep talk for a while.\nBe playful. Being playful means not taking yourself too seriously, being a bit silly, playfully hitting your crush, or talking about something slightly offbeat or unexpected. It also means not putting too much pressure on yourself over the course of the conversation."", '6. Use body language to communicate your intentions. Non-verbal cues can say a lot more about how you feel than what\'s actually coming out of your mouth, so make sure you\'re communicating how you feel. Try the following:\nKeep your stance ""open.""  Don\'t cross your arms or legs, as these are generally signs that you wish to isolate yourself from the other person.\nTurn your body toward the other person. Stand or sit so that you\'re facing the person you\'re flirting up.  Angle your torso toward him or her, or point your feet in that direction.\nBreak the ""touch barrier"". Casually initiate physical contact by touching him or her on the forearm as you talk, or by ""accidentally"" walking too close and brushing up against the other person.\nPlay with your hair (girls). Playing with your hair is usually a sign of nervousness, which is a good thing if you like the other person — you almost want him or her to know you\'re nervous because it means you\'re interested. To consciously communicate this, slowly twirl a strand of hair around your finger as you talk.', '7. Break the touch barrier. The first few times you touch your crush, be careful not to ""trap"" him or her. Depending on the area, the contact should be long enough to be more than accidental, but no more. Avoid grasping a hand or arm, and instead try gestures such as brushing an imaginary speck of dirt off of their arm, or ""accidentally"" touching feet or knees without pulling away.\nAll of these touches can be rejected without humiliation or offense, so if your crush is not ready for that kind of contact, you will not be forcing them to reject you entirely.', '8. Compliment the other person early in the conversation. It might seem too forward, but letting him or her know you\'re interested in dating before a solid friendship begins is the easiest way to detour around the friend-zone.  Get confident, and don\'t let the opportunity slip by — you never know when you\'ll get another one. Here are some techniques to try:\n\nMaintain eye contact while you\'re complimenting. Looking away might accidentally make you seem insincere.\n\nLower the tone and volume of your voice slightly. Paying a compliment in a slightly lower register than your usual speaking voice makes it seem intimate and sexy. Plus, it might also coax the other person to come closer to hear you.\n\nUse your crush\'s other interests to your advantage. If you know this person is dating (or interested in) someone else, you can use this to your advantage in a compliment.\n\nTry weaving the compliment into the conversation. For instance, if the girl you like is talking about how she had a terrible day, you could say something like ""I hate seeing someone as beautiful as you feel so unhappy. What can I do to help?""\n\nBe careful about complimenting looks. A girl might like it if you notice her eyes, but she might label you as creepy if you say she has a nice figure too soon. Play it safe and stick to these physical features:\nEyes\nSmile\nLips\nHair\nHands', ""9. Keep your interactions short and sweet. Remember that the key to creating demand is making supply scarce, so try to limit your interactions with the object of your flirtations. Don't talk to him or her every single day. Make it a special event and save it for a few times a week.\nDon't let conversations drag on for more than 5 or 10 minutes. The longer they go on, the higher your odds of running into an awkward silence.\nLet the other person come to you. After you've put in the work of starting up the interaction and sparking an interest, pull back a bit and see if he or she seeks you out for an interaction. This can be a good way to gauge interest, as well as build tension."", '10. Close the deal. If your flirting has been successful so far, and you want to get to know the other person better, it\'s time to see if you can turn it into a date. Here are a few approaches:\nAsk if the other person has plans at a later date. For instance, you might say, ""So, what are you up to on Saturday night?"" Try to keep this an open question, instead of one that requires a yes or no answer — you\'ll get more information that way. Don\'t ask someone what he or she is doing tonight, or even tomorrow. Try to schedule the date a few days out so that you don\'t come off as overly desperate.\nSuggest a specific event and ask if he or she would like to come along.  This is the best approach if you\'re trying to arrange a group date.  You could say something like, ""So a bunch of us were going to see a movie on Friday, and I\'d really like it if you came with us.""\nBe straightforward.  If you\'re feeling extra confident, go in for the kill without any pretense.  For instance, you could say something like, ""I\'d really love to take you on a date. When are you free?""', '1. Keep your approach casual. Don\'t let yourself get so nervous that you forget basic conversational skills. Instead, try to stay calm and open the conversation in a low-pressure way. If you\'ve never chatted with the person online before, you may even find an excuse for talking to him, like asking a question about homework or talking about a sports team you both like. If you\'re texting a person for the first time, make sure he or she knows who you are and that they don\'t feel creeped out. Here are some ways to start a conversation through text or chatting:\n""Hey, how\'s it going?""\n""Did you see/hear [insert event you both know about here]?""\n""How\'s your week going?""', '2. Don\'t talk about yourself too much. The majority of people are most comfortable talking about themselves because it\'s a topic they know well. Instead of taking the easy way out and discussing you endlessly, encourage the other person to talk about him or herself. However, you can and should occasionally throw some personal facts in the person\'s direction to help them to ask questions about you in turn. The key is to leave it up to them to pursue an interest in things relevant to yourself.\nThis tactic actually serves two purposes: Not only does it keep the conversation going, but it allows you to find out more about your crush.\nYou don\'t have to possess prior information about the other person to do this step. If you don\'t know him or her very well yet, you can ask:\n""How did your day go?""\n""So, what do you do with your free time?""\n\nIf you do know the other person a bit, focus on a hobby or interest you\'re already aware of.  For instance, maybe he\'s really into basketball, or you know she loves to read. ""Did you see the game last night?"" or ""Have you read any good books lately?"" would be great starts.', '3. Know when to press for more information. You can keep the discussion lively and interesting without probing too deeply on personal topics. For instance, asking your crush what exactly he or she likes about running cross-country would be a great idea; asking him or her for more details on family relationships or close friendships would be too much, too soon. You can do it in a joking, flirtatious bantering way that doesn\'t feel too serious, or like you\'re interviewing the person. Here are some ways to ask for more information flirtatiously:\n""So are you planning on spending all night online or do you have more exciting plans for this evening?""\n""Are you going to kick some butt in tonight\'s game?""\n""I\'ve noticed the cute kitty in your profile picture. Is that who you spend most of your time with?""', '4. Compliment your crush early in the conversation. Don\'t chicken out and skip this step — it might seem difficult, but it\'s incredibly important. A compliment communicates that you\'re potentially interested in dating, and steers you away from the dreaded friend-zone. If you skip paying your crush a compliment and simply keep the conversation on a friendly level, it might be too late next time. Here are some basic compliments you could use:\nIf you don\'t know your crush very well yet, but you\'re working on it, use a compliment oriented in this direction. Say something like, ""It\'s so easy to talk to you,"" or ""I kind of can\'t believe I\'m getting to know someone as interesting as you.""\nTry weaving the compliment into the conversation. For instance, if the girl you like is talking about how she had a terrible day, you could say something like ""I hate seeing someone as beautiful as you feel so unhappy. What can I do to help?""', '5. Be bold. If none of the suggestions above appeal to you, go for broke and pay your crush a bold compliment. Try these possibilities, using the adjective that fits your crush best or substituting your own:\n""I hope you know you\'re gorgeous/beautiful/amazing/my favorite person to talk to/etc.""\n""Sorry if this is too forward, but I have to say that you\'re incredible/an amazing person/so beautiful/etc.""', '6. Don\'t come on too strong. Avoid loading compliments with feelings too early. Leaving a person slightly uncertain of the extent of your feelings for them can increase your attractiveness, giving you a bit of a mysterious edge. The point is not to make the person question whether you like them at all, but to make them wonder how much you like them. If you just openly say, ""I have a big crush on you"" or ""I\'ve always thought you were so hot,"" then you\'re taking the mystery out of the exchange.\nInstead, you can send a text or a message that says something like, ""You looked cute in your new sweater today"" or another comment that is nice and flirtatious without giving it all away.', '7. Convince your crush to pursue you instead of having to do the work yourself. Though flirting should let the person know that you like him or her, you shouldn\'t make it seem like you\'re doing all of the work. Instead, you should be just flattering enough so that the person knows you\'re interested, but leave him or her to wonder just how much you care. To achieve this, try phrasing compliments objectively rather than subjectively. Here are examples of objective vs subjective compliments:\n\n""I really like your eyes, they\'re so pretty."" On the surface, this compliment may seem fine, and it probably would be appreciated. However, a common flaw in phrasing a romantic compliment is to constantly use the words ""I like/love *insert trait here*"". They tell the person that they\'ve succeeded in winning your heart. This is great if you\'ve already built up a solid relationship, but early on it can make you seem ""too easy"".\n\n""You have great eyes, they\'re very pretty"". Although technically both sentences are you conveying that you like the person\'s eyes, this one makes it more of an observation than a personal opinion. It implies that you find the person attractive but does not confirm it outright. As such, the receiver will feel both flattered and drawn to figure out how much attractive you find them.', '8. Tease gently. Because you can\'t use body language to communicate over text or chat, you\'ll have to rely on your words to keep the mood light and fun. Rely on inside jokes (based on events you were both present for), sarcasm (""Yeah, I\'m SURE you look like an ogre in the morning ;)""), and exaggeration (""You\'re probably a million times better at this than I am"") in the beginning.\nMake it clear that you\'re kidding. The drawback of using text to communicate is that you can\'t always read the emotion behind the words. If you\'re going to flirt with someone by teasing them, make extra sure that you\'re implying it\'s a joke. You can use winking smiley faces, all caps, or exclamation points to communicate this. Just don\'t overdo it with the emoticons or it\'ll begin to feel corny for the other person.\nIf you\'ve already sent something that could be interpreted the wrong way, make your meaning crystal clear. Say something like ""(joke)"" or ""jk"" to make a quick save.', '9. Always leave your crush wanting more. As much as you might want to text this person forever, it\'s best to bow out before the conversation goes stale (as all conversations are bound to do at some point). The best way to avoid an awkward pause is to leave before one happens. Ending the conversation on a good note will lead your conversational partner to look forward to the next time you can chat.\nSet up your next interaction before you go. Throw out something like ""Hey, so I\'ll see you around tomorrow?"" or ""I\'ll talk to you soon.""\nIf you\'re chatting online, note that you enjoyed the conversation just before you leave. It doesn\'t have to be complicated — a simple ""This was awesome"" or ""I had a good time talking to you"" is enough. If you\'re texting, you can be a bit more casual about it.\nBe careful not to over-compliment your crush. Your compliments will have a lot less meaning if you bestow them for every single positive trait the person has. Instead, reserve them for meaningful things that are important to the person, such as complimenting a skill they take pride in.', ""10. Don't take it too seriously. Keep in mind that flirting is supposed to be fun and try not to be crushed if your efforts aren't successful — not every interaction will be a perfect 10. Stay positive, and try again with someone else. As with anything else, flirting improves with practice. Flirting also doesn't have to have an endgame; not every flirtation ends in a date. Sometimes, you may just want to flirt for the fun of it, instead of hoping it will go somewhere.\nFlirting can help you meet new people, feel more comfortable, and learn to mingle. You don't need to put any pressure on yourself to make it mean something or to be perfect.""]"
Sports and Fitness,"['1. Do push-ups to strengthen your triceps, shoulders, and chest. Push-ups are the bread and butter of home workouts. Make sure your form is good to get the most out of it. Your spine should be straight and in line with your bottom, which isn\'t sagging. Your palms are generally a little wider than your shoulders, but you can go wider for a better chest workout and narrower for a better arm workout. In addition, you should mix in incline and decline push-ups for better overall muscle growth.\nIncline push-ups work different muscle heads. To do them, simply plant your arms on a low coffee table or chair so that you\'re angled up.\nDecline push-ups require your place your feet 1–2 feet (0.30–0.61 m) above your hands, then performing normal push-ups. Remember to keep your head up and spine straight.\nEach set should be eight to twelve reps. You might try doing up to three sets.\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMD\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichele Dolan\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCertified Personal Trainer\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMichele Dolan is a BCRPA certified Personal Trainer in British Columbia. She has been a personal trainer and fitness instructor since 2002.\t\t\t\t\tMD\t\t\t\t\tMichele Dolan\t\t\tCertified Personal Trainer\t\t\t\tMichele Dolan, a licensed personal trainer, recommends: ""It is best to space out your workouts so that you are not repeating the same workout every day. If you do the same exercises every day, your muscles won\'t get the chance to repair and grow.""', '2. Do handstands against the wall to build your shoulders and back. Not for the faint of heart, handstands are nonetheless great multi-muscle workout. To get into position, crouch with your back to the wall. Plant your hands on the ground and ""walk"" your feet slowly up the wall. From there, use your toes for balance, and slowly lower your head to the ground, pushing back up to complete one rep. Try to get three sets of ten in.\nIf you\'re too nervous for this, you can cheat with a high table. Place your feet on the table with your thighs and torso hanging over the edge, enough that you can place your hands on the ground. Then do a push-up with your head hanging straight down.  This is often called a pike push-up.', ""3. Do dips to work out your arms. For good dips, you'll need a sturdy bench, table, or chair roughly 1–2 feet (0.3–0.6 m) above the ground. Place your hands behind you on this bench so that your butt is in the air and your knees bent 90 degrees. With your feet firmly on the ground, lower your butt to the ground until your arms are bent at roughly 90 degrees. Push back up. Repeat for three sets of up to 15-20 reps."", '4. Do planks. Planks are a great way to work your entire core, and they are easily adapted for an extra challenge. To do one, get in push-up position. However, instead of placing your palms on the ground, rest on your forearms. Tighten your butt muscles and straighten your spine -- you should be able to rest a broom between your neck and butt. Hold this position for one minute, rest, and repeat two more times.\nSide planks are when you open your body, resting on one forearm and the outside of the same foot. Again, keep your spine straight by focusing on keeping your butt up.\nPlank to Push-up: Start in a plank position with your arms shoulder width apart and your feet hip width apart. Move down onto your forearms so that you are now in a forearm plank, then lift yourself back up to a full plank position. Do 12 reps in each set.', '5. Do crunches to build your abs and core. Crunches are still some of the best possible ab workouts out there, so get working. Lay on your back with your feet planted and your knees bent. Supporting your neck with your hands, raise your shoulders 6-8"" off the ground, hold for one second, then slowly lower yourself back down. Immediately bounce back up, keeping your eyes on the sky and making your movements slow and deliberate. Aim for three sets of eight to twelve  reps.\nStraight Leg sit-up: Lay on your back with your legs extended fully, the reach your arms up towards the ceiling and perform a sit-up, keeping your legs straight. Bring your arms down, trying to touch your toes, and then slowly lower back down. Do 10 reps.', '6. Use a gallon of milk, a heavy book, or home dumbbells to perform basic curls. While the rest of the exercises require little to no equipment, most upper body workouts require some sort of resistance in order to be effective. Once you have a weight you can comfortably hold, try out:\nBicep Curls\nTricep workouts\n\nShoulder raises.\nBent Over Rows', ""1. Use intense bursts of cardio to build leg muscles quickly. While most people don't equate building muscles with cardio, there is a variety of exercises you can string together to build lean, powerful leg muscles. Take 5-6 exercises and perform each one for 60 seconds. Rest for 30 seconds, then move on to the next one. After you finish all six exercises, rest for 4-5 minutes, then repeat 2-3 more times. You're legs will burn, but you'll quickly whip them into shape:\nJumping jacks\nLunges\nBurpees -- do a jumping jack, then drop into a push-up. Repeat.\nHigh Knees -- bouncing from toe to toe lift each knee as high as possible. You want to touch the floor as little as possible.\nLateral Jumps -- jump to one side, landing on one foot, knee bent, then explode back and onto the other foot.\nOblique twists\n\nBox jumps or simple plyometric workouts."", '2. Do wall sits. With your back to the wall for balance, ""sit"" down so that your knees are bent 90 degrees and your butt hangs in the air as if you were in a chair. Hold this position for one minute. Rest for 30 seconds and repeat two more times.', '3. Do squats. To perform a squat, stand with your feet hip-width apart, back straight, head up, bracing your core. Put your hands on your hips or straight out in front of you, whatever is more comfortable. Lower yourself down into a squat as if you were about to sit in a chair. You want to keep your spine straight and your knees right above your toes, not leaning forward. Focus on dropping your butt. Do this 10 times, then do another 2 sets after a short a rest.\nBulgarian Split Squat: Put your front foot flat on the ground and place your rear foot on a surface like a coffee table or your couch. Lower down into a squat, and then lift yourself back up. You can keep your hands out for balance, or on your hips. Do 12 reps on each leg.', '4. Do donkey kicks. Get on your hands and knees and kick one leg out and up, keeping it in a 90-degree angle. Do 12 reps on each leg.', '5. Try glute bridges. Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet on the floor. Lift your glutes off the ground to form a bridge. Lift your left leg up, keeping your hips up, and then lower your left leg down before doing the same move with your right leg. Do 10 reps with each leg.', '6. Work on your lunges. Lunges are a great way to build butt, hip, and hamstring muscles. To do one. Step one foot roughly 3–4 feet (0.9–1 m) in front of you. Your knee should be bent roughly 90 degrees. Lower your butt straight down to the floor, keeping your front knee over your toe and bending your back knee to the floor. Push back up and switch legs to finish one rep. Perform 10 on each side, then rest before 2 more sets.\nIf you have dumbbells or weights you can make the workout harder and significantly increase your conditioning. Even a gallon of milk in each hand will help.', ""1. Make a workout schedule that hits every muscle group twice a week. Developing an effective workout schedule is not something you need a trainer to do. There are several simple, easy to remember guidelines to follow that will allow you to get the most out of your workouts, building muscle quickly and safely.\nAllow 1-2 days of rest between similar workouts. If you work out your chest muscles on Tuesday, don't work them again until Thursday or Friday.\nGroup similar muscle groups for workouts. For example, since many chest exercises also work out your triceps, group these exercises on the same day.\nProvide 1-2 rest days where you go for  a short run or avoid hard physical activity. Your body needs time to rest and recover to build muscle."", '2. Focus on great form, not extra repetitions, to gain muscle quickly and safely. Doing ten proper push-ups is far more effective than fifteen bad ones. You want every exercise motion to be smooth, fluid, and slow, not herky-jerky and awkward. While each exercise is different, some general tips include:\nInhale as you come up, or relax. Exhale on the exertion.\nKeep your spine straight, not curved or bent, as much as possible.\nHold each exercise for 1-2 seconds at the apex, then slowly move back to resting position.', ""3. Do yoga to stretch muscles with a full-body workout. Yoga is another option for working out larger muscle groups, as it helps you strengthen your muscles and gain flexibility. Easy, calm sessions are great for rest days, and you can push yourself with harder workouts to mix up your routine. If you're struggling to find exercises that you enjoy without gym equipment, yoga might be the simple answer.\nYoutube contains a treasure trove of yoga workouts for any skill level, so don't feel intimidated if you're new to yoga -- you can practice in your own home with little equipment."", ""4. Push yourself so that the last 2-3 reps of every set are difficult, but not impossible. If you really want to gain muscle, you're going to need to push yourself. Your own body is the best indicator of your workout, so keep working the muscle until it is tired. You should be struggling slightly at the end of each set, and the last 2-3 exercises you do should require full concentration and effort.\nMake goals in advance. If you decide to do three sets of twenty ahead of time, you're more likely to finish the set while you're sweating. Then, if it is too easy, you can always add more.\nPushing yourself is different from courting injury. If your joints, bones, or muscles hurt, as opposed to just feel sore or tired, you should stop and rest."", ""5. Eat a balanced diet that is heavy on protein but low on fat. This doesn't mean that you need to be pounding protein shakes every day or cutting out every dessert. A good diet is a balanced diet, focusing on whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and lean proteins like chicken, fish, eggs, and beans.\nA glass of low-fat chocolate milk is an excellent post-workout snack.\nSwitching from white bread and pastas to whole grains is a great way to immediately eat healthier.\nAvocados, nuts, olive oil, and eggs all contain healthy fats. The ones to watch out for -- butter, cream, lard, etc. -- are almost always the foods you already know are unhealthy."", '6. Consider buying some basic home-gym equipment if you\'re serious about working out. There is a large variety of equipment that can help you perform new exercises and challenge yourself further, but you don\'t need expensive machines to do it.\nResistance bands are adaptable, come in a variety of ""weights"" and can be used for thousands of exercises.\nA basic set of dumbbells is a cost-effective way to add some weight to your workouts.\nPull-up/chin-up bars are designed to fit safely into most door frames, and many models can be used for dips and incline push-ups as well.\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaila Ajani\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFitness Trainer\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLaila Ajani is a Fitness Trainer and founder of Push Personal Fitness, a personal training organization based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Holidays and Traditions,"['1. Place a piece of tape over both ends of the egg. This will prevent the eggshell from cracking when you poke holes in it. Stick a small piece of tape onto the top of the egg, and another piece on the bottom.\nYou can use clear tape or masking tape.\nChicken eggs are most commonly used. However, you can blow out any type of egg. For example, turkey or duck eggs are larger than chicken eggs, while quail eggs are smaller.', '2. Poke a small hole in the top of the egg with a thumbtack. Gently press the pointy end of a thumbtack through the tape and into the egg at the very top. Twist the thumbtack carefully once it’s through the shell to slightly widen the hole to about ⁄8 inch (0.32 cm).\nIf you don’t have a thumbtack, you can use any object that has a thin, pointed tip, like a needle or nail.\nOther Ways to Make a Hole in an Egg\nUse a hammer to carefully tap a very thin nail into the top of the egg.\nBuy an egg-piercing tool from a kitchenware store or an online retailer.\nPoke a hole with a small rotary tool or hand drill.', '3. Flip the egg over and poke a slightly larger hole in the bottom. This is the hole the yolk will come out of. Turn the egg upside down and push the thumbtack through the tape and into the eggshell in the center of the bottom. Once the thumbtack is in, rotate it around very carefully to widen the hole a little larger than the one you made at the top.\nThe hole should be no more than ⁄16 inch (0.79 cm) in diameter.\nDo this over a bowl or the sink in case anything leaks out of the hole you made on the top.', '4. Insert a straightened-out paperclip into either hole and wiggle it around. This breaks up the yolk so that you can blow it out more easily. Unbend a paperclip into a straight piece of wire, then slide it into either the top or bottom hole. Move it around once it’s all the way inside the egg, as if you were stirring it up.\nYou can also use a pin, toothpick, or needle to do this.\nBe careful not to wiggle the paperclip too forcefully or you’ll crack the egg.', ""5. Blow through the small hole at the top to push the yolk out of the bottom. Press your mouth against the top of the egg, over the hole. Breathe in through your nose, then breathe out forcefully through your mouth, blowing the air into the egg. The yolk will come out of the bottom hole as you blow.\nHold the egg over a bowl to catch the yolk when it comes out.\nIf you’re having trouble getting the yolk to come out, try making the hole at the bottom a little bigger or shaking the egg to break up the yolk more.\nIf you don't want to use your mouth on the egg, you can place the tip of a rubber ear syringe into the hole and squeeze the syringe to push out the yolk. You can also put a straw over the hole to blow out the egg."", '6. Rinse the empty shells and let them dry overnight. Gently run the eggshells under water to remove any extra pieces of yolk that may still be inside. Hold the egg with the top hole facing up so that the water runs through the egg and out the bottom hole. Set the eggs on a towel to dry.\nIf you’re going to paint or dye the eggs, make sure they’re completely dry first. Otherwise, the colors will run or wipe off.\nYou can also set the eggs in an empty carton or on bamboo skewers to dry. Slide the skewers carefully through the 2 holes of each egg.\nTo sanitize the eggs while you rinse them, use a little bit of dish soap or vinegar along with the water.', '1. Apply decoupage glue and water over the eggs to make them last longer. Mix 1 part decoupage glue and 1 part water in a small bowl. Brush the mixture onto the outside of the eggs with a small paintbrush, then use an eyedropper to squeeze 2 to 3 drops into one of the holes on the egg. Close both holes with your fingers and shake the liquid to coat the inside of the egg. Let the eggs dry completely.\nYou can buy decoupage glue from a craft store or an online retailer.\nPlace a towel under the eggs while they dry since some remaining liquid may come out.', '2. Dye the eggs with food coloring for a pretty spring decoration. Mix ⁄2 cup (120 ml) of hot water, 1 teaspoon (4.9 ml) of vinegar, and 10 to 20 drops of food coloring in a small bowl or mug. Place an egg into the mixture so that it’s completely submerged, then let it soak for 5 to 10 minutes. Once it’s the color that you want, take it out of the dye using a spoon or tongs and place it on a paper towel to dry.\nThe longer you let the egg soak, the deeper the color will be.\nGet creative with your colors and designs. Try mixing different colors or making fun patterns, for example.\nDifferent Ways to Dye Your Blown-Out Eggs\nTo make stripes, wrap clear tape around the egg before you dye it. Anywhere that’s covered in tape won’t be dyed. You can do the same thing with circular stickers to make polka dots.\nFor an ombre effect, use tongs to hold the egg so that just the bottom is in the dye. After 3 minutes, lower the egg further into the dye, about another ⁄4 inch (0.64 cm) for another 3 minutes. Continue to make layers down the whole egg.\nIf you want to add a glittery accent, add metallic temporary tattoos to the egg after the dye has dried. Carefully lay the tattoo onto the egg, then wipe a damp cloth over it before removing the paper backing.\nFor cute egg faces, glue googly eyes onto the egg after you dye it and draw mouths or noses with a permanent marker.', '3. Draw designs with puff paint if you want eggs with texture. Squeeze acrylic puff paint onto the eggshell to create 3D patterns like stripes, swirls, or dots. Let the paint dry for 2 to 3 hours.\nYou can also make a design with puff paint, then paint over it with acrylic paint once the puff paint has dried. This creates a cool raised effect underneath.\nTo prevent the paint from smearing while it dries, slide a bamboo skewer through the holes. Stand the skewer upright or lay it over an empty container so the egg is suspended in the air.', '4. Use washi tape to add colorful accents to the eggshells. You can find washi tape in all different patterns, colors, and textures at a craft store. Wrap 2 to 3 strips of the tape around an egg if you want to leave some of the shell showing, or cover the egg completely with tape for an all-over decoration.\nIf you want an artsy mosaic look, cut out small pieces of washi tape and arrange them around the egg, leaving white space in between each piece.\nYou can also paint the egg with acrylic paint first if you want a more colorful craft. Let the paint dry completely for 2 to 3 hours before you add your washi tape on top.', '5. Attach an ornament cap to hang the eggs on a Christmas tree. Squeeze the 2 prongs of the cap together to slide them into the hole at the top of the egg. Once the prongs are inside, they’ll spread out, holding the cap in place. Hang your ornaments on a tree by tying a piece of ribbon to the cap or using a wire hanger.\nYou can buy ornament caps from a craft store or an online retailer. At the store, they’re usually in the holiday section.\nInstead of buying new caps, you can take the caps off of old ornaments you no longer use.\nFor an extra festive decoration, paint the eggs in holiday colors or add stickers before you attach the caps.']"
Personal Care and Style,"[""1. Clarify with a shampoo (for the last time) before beginning. This will cleanse your hair of any silicones – ingredients in some hair products that are not water-soluble (see the Warnings section below). You do not have to buy a new shampoo for this step, just use something lying around the house.\nUsing a clarifying shampoo will also remove the oil, dirt, and styling products built up on your hair and scalp. You’ll want to be rid of this before going “no-poo.”\nSulfate containing and sulfate free shampoos will both work to remove most silicones. But to be safe, it's best to use a sulfate containing shampoo for your last wash."", '2. Throw out your shampoo! Most shampoos contain harsh, drying sulfates that are extremely damaging for curly hair (ammonium laureth sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, sodium laureth sulfate, sodium lauryl sulfate, etc.). These common detergents found in shampoos make curly hair frizzy and uncooperative.\nConditioner can be used sufficiently to clean the hair in a much more gentle manner. If you cannot let go of shampoo, use a more gentle shampoo that contains mild cleansers (i.e. cocamidopropyl betaine or coco betaine) such as a sulfate-free shampoo.\n\n""You\'d never dream of washing a good sweater with detergent. Yet most shampoos contain harsh detergents (sodium lauryl sulfate or laureth sulfate) that one also finds in dish washing liquid. They\'re great for pots and pans because they cut grease so effectively. Your hair, on the other hand, needs to retain some natural oils, which protect your hair and scalp. Stripping them away deprives the hair of necessary moisture and amino acids and makes it look dry and dull."" - Lorraine Massey\nTo the bottom is an image of a shampoo and a bottle of dish detergent. Above, the same sulfate is circled in their ingredients list.', '3. Buy silicone free conditioners and styling products. You will probably want a conditioner for washing your scalp, a thick moisturizing conditioner to moisturize the length of your hair, and a conditioner to leave in during the day. You can use the same conditioner or different ones. You will also want any serums, gels, or mousses, but keep in mind these all need to be free of silicones. (You may also want a sulfate free shampoo if you spend a lot of time in chlorine.) \nA clarifying shampoo that’s sulfate-free is safe to use on curly hair to remove chlorine.\nFor more information about getting the right ingredients check out the tips section or read How to Determine if a Hair Product is Curly Girl Approved.', ""4. Have your hair trimmed.  This will get rid of any damage or split ends. If you don't want to visit a hair salon you can always trim your own, of course."", '1. Wash your scalp with conditioner (conditioner washing). Begin your routine by wetting your hair in the shower. Distribute conditioner on your entire scalp and massage your scalp with the tips of your fingers (not your fingernails). This rubbing action and the resulting friction will loosen dirt, product residue, and dandruff which can then be rinsed away. (Be sure to avoid silicone in your hair products, see the Warnings.) Thoroughly rinse your scalp afterwards, still massaging with your fingertips as you do so. Depending on how dry your scalp is, you can conditioner wash, once a week, twice a week, or every day.\n\n""The curly-haired can leave their hair hydrated with natural oils and clean their scalps quite well by rinsing only with hair conditioner once a week or less. Rubbing the scalp firmly with fingers is enough to loosen dirt."" - Lorraine Massey', '2. Distribute conditioner throughout all of your hair and untangle gently. Use your hands or a wide-toothed comb. Start by untangling bottom sections of your hair and then gradually move upwards. Let the conditioner sit in your hair for five minutes or so for extra moisture.\nYou also may want to part your hair at this point with a comb. It\'s recommended that you part your hair to the side to prevent ""triangle-shaped"" hair.\nIf it is difficult to untangle your hair this way, remember to use a large quantity of conditioner when wet or you may need to trim dead ends\nUntangling hair while dry with any tool is not a good idea. Separating the curls dry just causes more frizz and damages the hair. It’s also painful and time-consuming.', ""3. Do the final rinse of your hair with cool or cold water. Cool and cold water seal the hair’s cuticle and lock in moisture. This will decrease frizz and add shine. Leave some conditioner in your hair, especially in dry sections like the ends. It's fine to run your fingers through your hair gently, but do not comb your hair after this point."", ""4. Apply products to your hair. Do this while your hair is soaking wet if you have curlier hair, but wait five minutes or so if you have medium to wavy curly hair. Put product in your hands and rub them together to emulsify. Then, smooth or rake the product into your hair by sections. \nA common method is to begin with a leave-in cream or conditioner to decrease frizz and then follow with a gel or mousse for hold and definition. (Using your normal conditioner as a leave-in is fine too. Some prefer curl creams or just conditioner for softer curls, however these products will not help the hair last as well for second day hair.\nAfter the leave-in conditioner but before the gel or curl cream is applied, it’s also common to apply a light oil on the hair. This is known as the LOC method (LOC=leave-in, oil, cream), and doesn't have to used in this specific order.\nUse whatever type and order of products you like (as long as they are silicone free). Next, finger shape the curls by scrunching them (cup your hair in the palms of your hands and scrunch in an upward motion) and/or twisting individual curls around a finger."", '5. Gently scrunch your hair with a t-shirt, paper towels, or a micro-fiber towel to remove excess moisture. A generic terrycloth towel will make your hair frizzy. You may wish to finger shape your curls at this time instead. Next, wait five or so minutes so the hair can assume a permanent shape.', '6. Decrease the drying time of your hair by plopping. Spread an old t-shirt or micro-fiber towel onto a flat surface (such as the toilet with seat down). Bend over at the waist and position your hair in the middle of the cloth. With your head touching the cloth, drape the back section of cloth over your head. Twist the sides until they form ""sausage rolls"" and clip or tie them at the base of your neck. You can also use the sleeves of a long sleeve t-shirt to secure. After 15-30 minutes remove the cloth. If your hair is frizzy after plopping lightly graze the hair with gel.\nPlopping works best for medium to long length curly hair. The curls usually become weirdly squished after plopping in shorter hair. See How to Plop Your Hair for more info as well.', '7. Dry your hair. Air drying is the easiest and gentlest way to dry your hair. If you must blow dry your hair use a diffuser to avoid frizz. Only dry your hair partially (about 80 percent dry) and air-dry the rest of the way.Do not touch your hair while it is drying or it will mess up and frizz. Both types of diffusers work well in terms of diffusing and decreasing frizz:\nA bowl diffuser with fingers causes more volume and clumping (curls sticking together instead of going every which way), is bulky and heavier, and will probably only fit on the hairdryer it comes with. Place a section of hair in the bowl and press the bowl to your head. Then turn on the ""warm"" setting of your blow dryer. Press the cool shot if your head gets too hot.\nA sock diffuser is lightweight, fits on any hair dryer, and is portable. Aim the diffuser at different parts of your hair while you scrunch your hair with your hands. Stop scrunching when your hair is about 50% dry.', '1. Find an experienced hairstylist. Not all hair dressers were created equal, so ask your stylist in advance if they are experienced in cutting curly hair and what products they are going to use on your hair. Unplanned haircuts can be disastrous for curly hair. If their products contains silicones, you may want to insist on bringing your own. If your hairstylist uses a razor to thin out your hair it will make your ends ratty and prone to split ends. Remember, it takes a skilled hairdresser to successfully cut layers or other haircuts in curly hair.', ""2. Have your hair trimmed every four to six months. A 1/2-inch or 1/4-inch trim is usually enough to get rid of split ends. Long, rounded layers are more suited to curly hair--short layers tend to stick up and look funny. Curly hair usually consists of a combination of textures, with the crown being the curliest part. \nCurly hair should be cut when it’s dry because hair tends to shrink when wet. On average, hair shrinks about 40% when wet, making it hard to tell what the hair will look like when dry. Also, take into account that curly hair is much shorter when dry than wet.  You may lose only two inches while wet, but that could be four or five while dry!\nIf you're constantly styling your hair, or if your hair grows faster than normal, a trim may be needed more often than every 4-6 months. On average, hair grows about half an inch per month."", '3. Give your hair time to adjust. It takes 2 to 6 weeks for your hair to adjust to the no shampoo and it may even look worse at first. Hair is a long-term project and it may take a couple weeks for it to regain its health after being stripped of moisture for years by shampoo.', '4. Show off your glamorous, beautiful curls!']"
Personal Care and Style,"[""1. Choose a comfortable location. Using a massage table will give you the best access to somebody's back, and it's built for comfort, complete with a face cradle for alignment of the spine. However, if that's not available, there are a few alternatives.\nIf you don't have access to a massage table, then you can try using the floor, a couch, a bed, or even a kitchen table if it’s sturdy enough for the person to lie on. Each option has drawbacks that make it less ideal than a massage table, mostly due to comfort issues for the person receiving the massage and height issues requiring the person giving the massage to lean over in uncomfortable ways.\nIf a bed is the best option available, make sure that the suggestion doesn’t come across as inappropriate. Consider the relationship you have with the person and discuss that the massage will take place on a bed beforehand."", '2. Place a soft mat down. If you don’t have access to a massage table, and you’re opting for one of the harder-surfaced alternatives, then lay down a soft mat. Use a mat that is at least two inches thick to provide the proper comfort for the person receiving the massage.', '3. Spread a sheet over the table or mat. Since the person will dress down most or all of the way for his or her massage, a clean sheet over the mat or table will be both more hygienic and more comfortable for the person. It will also catch any excess oil.', ""4. Prepare the room. Make sure the room is warm without being hot. This is the ideal atmosphere for the person to relax the muscles you’re trying to massage.\nPlay some uneventful music. New age, ambient music, quiet classical music, or even soundscapes will help the person relax to their fullest. Pulsing, driving music won't help. Keep the volume low.\nTurn the lights down just enough so there's no glare in the room.\nLight scented aromatherapy candles. This is optional, and you should ask the person before lighting the candles since some people enjoy the smells while others are too sensitive to them."", '5. Have the person undress to his or her comfort level. Massage is best given and received without clothing on the area being massaged, especially if you are using oil or lotion. Request that the person undresses as much as he or she is comfortable with.\nAlways provide an additional towel or sheet above and beyond the one covering the table. This way the person can lie down and cover the parts of his or her body not being massaged. This will make the environment both more comfortable and warmer, which is relaxing.\nIf privacy is a concern, step out of the room as you have the person dress down and cover himself/herself with the additional towel or sheet. Knock and ensure that the person is ready for reentering the room.\nIf the person left pants or underwear on, you could tuck the edge of the towel or sheet into the waistband to ensure no oil from the massage stains the material.', ""6. Have the person lie face down. If you have a proper massage table, this means the person’s face will rest in the face cradle.\nIf it’s comfortable for the person, you can also use a pillow or folded towel beneath the ankles. This will support the person's lower back."", '7. Expose the person’s back. If the person wrapped a towel while undressing or pulled the additional sheet all the way up, then fold the material down to expose the person’s back.', ""1. Tell the person you are about to begin. Tell them to let you know if anything you are doing is painful or uncomfortable. Part of them being comfortable is having a feeling of trust in you. This is not the time to make jokes or suggestive comments.\nPeriodically remind the person to take a slow, deep breath. It will help with relaxation.\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWill Fuller\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCertified Massage Therapist\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWill Fuller is a Certified Massage Therapist and Wellness Educator working in San Francisco, California.

Ask where the pain is, if they have any diagnosis, and whether they've gone to physical therapy or seen a chiropractor. You need a good picture of the person's situation before you start so that you help alleviate their pain and not make it worse."", '2. Pour massage oil in the palm of your hand. Start with about one teaspoon, which is roughly the size of a quarter. Warm it by rubbing it between your hands before applying it to the person.\nGood oils to use are organic coconut oil, grape seed oil, jojoba oil, or almond oil. There are many expensive scented and speciality massage oils on the market you can try too.', '3. Spread the oil around. The main technique for spreading the warmed oil across the person’s back is called effleurage, which means “light friction.” Use gliding movements in long, even strokes.\nUse the whole of your hands and start at the bottom of the person’s back, moving upward. Always upward toward the heart (the direction of blood flow) while applying pressure, and then lightly bring the hands down the outside of the back lightly. Maintain contact without applying pressure as you bring your hands back down.\nRepeat this technique for 3-5 minutes while gradually increasing from light to medium pressure to warm up the back muscles.\nDon’t forget the shoulders and neck area.', '4. Use petrissage techniques. Petrissage uses shorter, circular strokes with more pressure than effleurage. You can think of this as a kneading technique that uses rolling and pressing to enhance deeper circulation.\nThis technique can use the palm, fingertips, or even the knuckles in the short, circular motions.\nThe movement should come from the waist—your core—rather than from the shoulders. This will help keep you from becoming fatigued.\nGo across the entire back for 2-5 minutes. You can alternate between this and lighter effleurage movements to diversify techniques.\nWithout professional training, use only light to medium pressure while applying petrissage movements.', '5. Apply percussive strokes. Percussive strokes (also known as tapotement) are collections of brief, repetitive contacts with parts of the hand. You can use your cupped hands, your fingertips all gathered to an even point, or even the flat of your fingers on the knuckle side of your hands to make the contacts. These movements have a stimulating, compressive effect on the tissue.\nKeep your wrists relaxed and flex at the wrists, using quick movements to perform tapotement techniques. This ensures that you don’t apply too much pressure.\nSpend 2-3 minutes applying the techniques across the person’s entire back.', '6. Use muscle-lifting techniques. To perform this, close your fingers and hold out your thumb (in a “lobster claw” shape). Apply pressure in a twisting, lifting motion. Keep alternating hands in a “windshield wiper” movement.\nMove up and down the back 2-3 times.', '7. Use a fanning technique. Position yourself at the head of the table. Position your thumbs at the top of the back, just below the neck and on either side of the spine. Using a ""fanning"" motion with your thumbs extended, push gently down toward the lower back with your pressure angled at the person’s feet, not down towards the ground. Alternate your pressure on either thumb, moving from the top of the back all the way down to the person\'s hips.\nMake sure you are massaging the muscles on either side of the spine, not directly on the spine itself. Massaging over the spine can be very uncomfortable and dangerous if you are not trained properly.', ""8. Apply twists. Come back around to the person's side. Reach around the far hip with one hand, while the other hand rests on the near hip. With a fluid motion, pull one hand towards you as the other one pushes away; in the middle, they should slide against each other, in opposite directions. Repeat this stroke up the back until you reach the shoulder area, then come back down. Repeat three times.""]"
Hobbies and Crafts,"['1. Determine who will have the first turn. Before you set up the board, you need to choose who goes first. You can do this based on who won the last game, a coin toss, or by any other method. The person who will go first will take the black checkers and the other will take the white.\nKeep in mind that in checkers, the player with the black checkers always goes first.', '2. Set up the board. Sit across from your opponent and place the board between you and your opponent. The board is made up of 64 alternating dark and light squares which appear in 8 rows of 8. There are 32 light squares and 32 dark squares. Place the board so that each player has a light colored square on the corner of the board on his or her right side.', ""3. Place the checkers on the board. Have each player place his pieces on the 12 dark squares in the first three rows closest to him or her. Each of these three rows should have a total of 4 checkers. Remember that checkers may only move in diagonal directions on the dark squares.\nSince the board has 8 rows, 6 of the rows will be taken up by the players' checkers and two rows will be left open in the middle of the board."", '4. Decide if you are going to time each other’s moves. In tournament checkers games, each player gets five minutes to make a move. If you want to time each other’s moves to keep the game moving along, make sure that you place a timer near the checkers board before you begin a game.', '1. Start the game. The player with the black checkers moves first. Checkers may only move one diagonal space forward (toward your opponent’s checkers) in the beginning of the game. Remember that checkers must stay on the dark squares.', ""2. Jump and capture your opponent's checkers. If your checker is located in the diagonal space nearest to your opponent's checker, then you can jump and capture that checker. To capture a checker, just jump over it by moving two diagonal spaces in the direction of the checker, like you are hopping over your opponent's checker. Once you capture the checker, you can take it off the board.\nKeep in mind that a space on the other side of your opponent’s checker has to be empty so that you can move into it.\nIf you have the opportunity to jump your opponent's checker, then you have to take it.\nIf you have the opportunity to jump your opponent's checker in multiple parts of the board, then you can choose which checkers you'd like to jump.\nIf you're capturing a checker, you can still only move forward once. But if the new position you land in gives you a direct opportunity to capture another checker, then you must keep going until you can't capture any more of your opponent's checkers."", ""3. King your checkers when they reach the end of your opponent's board. To crown a checker and make it a king checker, simply place one of your own captured pieces on top of it. Because of its height, you will be able to tell it apart from the other pieces. The king can move forward and backward, so it's easier for king checkers to capture your opponent's checkers.\nKings can still only move one diagonal space at a time during a non-capture move. However, when a king is capturing checkers, it can move forward and backward on the same turn. This would apply only if a king was doing a capture move that required it to change directions, such as if two checkers were lined up on diagonal spaces that fall into the same horizontal line. To capture these checkers, the king would have to jump forwards and then backwards.\nSome checkers sets have a crown on the back of the checkers, so you can just flip a piece over once it is crowned to designate it as the king.\nThere is no limit to how many crowned pieces you can have."", ""4. Keep jumping and capturing. Continue jumping and capturing your opponent's checkers until they are all removed from the board.  Once you have captured all of your opponent’s checkers, you have won the game!\nA less common way to win is when all of your opponent's pieces are blocked so that your opponent can't make any more moves."", ""1. Play an offense game, not a defense game. A beginner may be tempted to keep his pieces at the edges of the board and to try to avoid the opponent's checkers as much as possible, but this is a mistake. Work on capturing your opponent’s checkers rather than going out of your way to defend your own. It’s okay if some of your pieces get captured as long as you capture more of your opponent’s pieces.\nBe bold and try to capture your opponent's checkers whenever you can."", ""2. Move your pieces together. If you move a stray checker a few squares forward without moving the rest of your checkers, that piece will be vulnerable to capture. Instead, try keeping some of your checkers together, like a blockade. The center of the board is a good place to a have a group of checkers protecting each other as they move forward. Just try not to move all of your checkers towards the center because it will be hard to move them.\nIf your checkers move together, it will be harder for your opponent to capture your checkers. But if your opponent does still manage to capture your checker, then you'll have a piece waiting to capture his checker as well."", '3. Keep a full back row for as long as you can. If your opponent gets a piece to your back row, then it will be crowned and more difficult to capture. Keeping a full back row is the best way to keep your opponent from crowning his pieces. It will also make it easier for you to capture any opposing pieces that approach your back row.', ""4. Know when to sacrifice your pieces. There's a right time for you to sacrifice your checkers. If you're ahead in the game, or even dead even with your opponent, don't be afraid to sacrifice a piece if it means you'll be able to capture your opponent's piece back or gain a significant positional advantage. Keep the forward momentum going.\nDo what you can to avoid having your king captured. The king is much more valuable than a regular checker.\nDon't trade pieces if it will make it easier for your opponent to king a piece.\nTrade one for two. Give up one of your pieces if it means you can capture two of your opponent's pieces in return."", ""5. Focus on the kings. You should focus on crowning as many of your pieces as possible, as well as on keeping your opponent from crowning his pieces. This should be a priority as you advance in the game. However, don't crown your pieces if it means losing several checkers on the way. Be strategic about knowing when to crown your piece."", ""6. Block your opponent. Try to keep his active pieces blocked if you can, so he will be forced to play with pieces such as those in the back row. If all your opponent's pieces are blocked and cannot move, then he will lose. You can also work on capturing more of your opponent’s pieces or crowning your own."", ""7. Keep practicing. Though there's no fool-proof way to win at checkers every single time, the more you play, the more you'll understand how to strategize. If you want to be a checkers expert, you should try to play as much as you can to improve your game.\nTry playing with someone above your skill level. This will challenge you and will force you to pick up your game."", ""8. Watch an expert. Watch an expert checkers player, either in person or on television. You'll pick up a lot of pointers just by watching an expert maneuver his pieces around the board. Pay attention to what the expert does in certain situations.\nTry reading about checkers strategies online or in books as well. Some checkers experts have written about their strategies and reading about them may help you to improve your game.""]"
Youth,"['1. Look at her stance. When a girl likes you, she will face in your direction. If a girl has her torso turned towards you in an open manner, this means that she is confident talking with you. If she has a closed body position, namely crossed arms or legs, she may be shy or nervous to talk to you or she may simply be creating a barrier to signal that she is uninterested.\nWhen she is sitting with her legs crossed, watch her feet. If they are pointed towards you, it might mean that she likes you and wants to get closer to you.\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElvina Lui, MFT\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMarriage & Family Therapist\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElvina Lui is a Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist specializing in relationship counseling based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Elvina received her Masters in Counseling from Western Seminary in 2007 and trained under the Asian Family Institute in San Francisco and the New Life Community Services in Santa Cruz. She has over 13 years of counseling experience and is trained in the harm reduction model.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tElvina Lui, MFT\t\t\tMarriage & Family Therapist\t\t\t\tOpen stances indicate relaxation and comfort. Couples counselor and MFT, Elvina Lui, tells us: ""Generally speaking a girl will stand closer to you and will have more relaxed body language if she feels comfortable around you — for example, she\'ll have relaxed shoulders and she won\'t cross her arms, But, everyone\'s personality and cultural upbringing is different, so don\'t take it as a sign she\'s not into you if this isn\'t the case.""', '2. Pay attention to eye contact. If a girl likes you, she will tend to either hold her gaze on you for a few seconds or glance down the moment your eyes make contact with hers. Either of these responses could mean that she likes you. If she pulls away quickly, it often means she is nervous or not ready to reveal her true intentions yet, but she may still like you.\nWhen a girl likes you, her pupils might dilate, though this will be hard to tell.\nIf you happen to glance at the girl and you see her staring back at you, this could mean that she likes you.', ""3. Take context into account. The way you interpret a girl's body language will vary depending on the context. For example, if you're talking one-on-one with a girl, her touching your arm for a few seconds could be considered flirting. However, if she quickly taps your shoulder to get your attention and tell you that your friend is looking for you, she may really just be trying to help, not flirt.\nIf you are having an intense conversation, a girl may look at you without breaking eye contact. This does not necessarily mean she likes you. It could just be a conversational practice of hers. However, if she makes eye contact with you for an extended period of time without talking, or if she looks at you and breaks away the minute you look back at her, she may be intrigued by you."", '4. Notice if she touches you or tries to get closer. When a girl likes you, she will often try to touch you, as this is a noticeable yet still subtle way to flirt. It allows a girl to size up how responsive you are. She may touch your arm when you say something funny, “accidentally” brush your shoulder or hands with hers, or gently place her hand on your knee.\nNot all girls will feel comfortable reaching out using touch. In this case, don\'t assume that she doesn\'t like you just because she doesn\'t try to touch you. She may be too nervous to do so. If you like her, don\'t be shy––break the touch barrier yourself and see how she responds.\nShe may also find other reasons to touch you, such as softly punching your arm. These ""one-of-the-mates"" moves can be a thinly disguised way of getting closer to you without it being too evident to your friends and hers.', '5. Pay attention to whether she randomly hugs you. This is especially significant if her random hugs are reserved mostly for you. Hugs are a friendly, affectionate way of getting closer to you and touching you without it necessarily compromising her stealthy flirting skills. Return the hug if you like her back, or gently refuse her hug if you don’t want her to get the wrong impression.', '6. See if she mirrors your moves. If a girl imitates you - for example, if you run your fingers through your hair and you notice her do the same a few seconds later - she may be subconsciously mirroring your movements. This can be a tell that she likes you.', '7. Notice if she’s playing with her hair. Gently twirling strands of her hair or partaking in other grooming behaviors like running her hands through her hair could be signs of flirting.', '8. Look for signs of nervousness or fidgeting. When a girl likes you, she will touch her lips, collarbone, or neck to draw your attention to these areas. She may even apply lipstick in front of you.', '9. Notice if she smiles around you. This may be her way of signaling to you that she’s comfortable and happy in your presence. When a girl likes you, she may also laugh at your jokes (regardless of how funny they actually are).', '1. Be receptive to compliments. If a girl compliments you, she could very well like you. This may be her way of making you feel desired. \nShe might say things like “you have amazing eyes” or “you’re so athletic - do you play any sports?”', '2. Observe her friends’ reactions. If you see most of her friends glancing back at you and smiling or giggling, this probably means that she has told her friends about you and they\'re ""in the know."" In some cases, a friend may actually be bold enough to come and tell you that her friend likes you.\nWhen she is having a conversation with her friends and you come over, they might stop talking all of a sudden. This likely means that you were the subject of the recently ended conversation.', '3. Notice her style. When a girl likes you, she will often try to impress you with her style. She may choose to wear slightly revealing clothes or put on lipstick to catch your eye.\nEvery girl has a different sense of style, and not all girls will try to dress as aforementioned when they like somebody. However, if you notice that the girl you’re wondering about dresses a little more nicely around you, it could be a sign that she wants to impress you.', '4. Be mindful of gentle, friendly teasing. When a girl likes you, she may tease you lightly about certain things you do or say. Ways of teasing include calling you out on a joke that actually wasn’t that funny, poking fun at something you’re wearing, or lightly telling you that you’re trying too hard.', '5. Notice if she makes excuses to talk to you. She may “friend” you on social media, talk to you in person every day after class, or text you randomly. These could be signs that this girl is intrigued and wants to get to know you more.\nThis alone is not a definitive sign that a girl likes you. A girl who just wants to be friends may also try to engage in conversation with you. But if a girl tries to talk to you often, exhibits a number of flirty body language cues, and compliments you often, she may be trying to tell you that she likes you.', '6. Notice if she mentions your relationship status. When a girl likes you, she will want to know whether you are single or not so that she can decide if she should flirt with you. She may directly ask you if you have a girlfriend or she may use a subtler approach.\nShe might tease you by saying things like “I bet you went to see that movie with your girlfriend.” If you like her, use this as an opportunity to flirt back. You could say “I don’t have a girlfriend, but I have been meaning to see that movie...want to go with me Friday night?”', '7. Look for ""damsel in distress"" moments. When a girl likes you, she may pretend to be in a mildly vulnerable situation to test your response. For example, if you\'re outside and the girl you like starts saying ""I\'m cold!"" that\'s a subtle hint that she wants you to give her your sweater. Doing so is a very sweet gesture, especially if you want to show the girl that you like her.\nSometimes a girl will pretend to be really bad at doing something, like saying she doesn’t understand the homework. That is your chance to offer some assistance; be aware that she will most likely be doing this on purpose just to test your reaction in hopes that you will help out.\nWhen offering assistance, if she doesn\'t fancy you but there is somebody she likes in the room, she may pout or show other signs of disappointment if you offer to help first. In this case, at least you\'ll know how she feels and will be able to move on.', ""8. Test her interest by asking her for help. If she's always there for you when you need her, she might like you. But don't assume that she's into you only from one experience. Ask her occasionally for small things, like chewing gum or a pen, and notice how she reacts. If she's eager to help you and shows other signs of liking you, then she very well might.\nDon’t use this approach too much or tasks that seem too difficult, she may think you're lazy, testing her, or are even a bit of a nuisance. So don't overdo it; you don't want to risk her ceasing to like you if she indeed does."", '9. Notice how she acts around others. If a girl flirts with you, it doesn’t necessarily mean that she likes you. She may just get a thrill out of flirting, or she may not even notice that she’s flirting. The best way to see if she is just flirting with you and it’s not just her naturally flirty demeanor coming through is to notice how she acts around other people. \nIf she treats you differently than she does others, be it by holding eye contact just a bit longer with you than with anybody else or by being gentler in her teasing with you, then she may like you.', '1. Smile at her. A natural, genuine, carefree smile is the perfect way to let a girl know that you like being around her. It will also let her know that you’re a happy person, and since happiness can be contagious, she’ll associate positive emotions with you. If she returns your smile, you can bet she feels comfortable around you.', '2. Strike up a conversation. This is a great way to gauge her interest level. As you talk, notice if she gives you any signs or hints that she likes you or if uses vaguely romantic language. She could also show her interest in you by nodding frequently or repeating some of your phrases.\nTo start a conversation, you can ask her an open-ended question about class, work, or pop culture. It could be something as simple as “what do you think about this band?” or “how’s your day going?”\nDon’t fret if the girl you like doesn’t initiate a conversation with you. If she likes you, she may be too shy or nervous to do so! Even if she seems like the most confident girl you know, she may have had a bad experience in the past or simply may not be ready to approach you yet but will be receptive if you start the conversation first.\nIf you’re already friends, starting a conversation will be easy. In this case, the most effective way to tell if she likes you is to pick up on body language cues or to see if she treats you differently than she does her other friends.', '3. Be attentive. If you like the girl, put your best foot forward by remembering a few small details about the things she tells you. Listen carefully to the things she says so that you will have them for future reference. \nFor example, if she tells you the name of her favorite band, bring up one of the band’s songs during your next chat. She’ll be impressed that you took notice! If she wasn’t already interested in you romantically, she might start to reconsider once she sees how attentive you are.\nTalking also provides another opportunity to observe her body language, so watch for physical cues such as subtle touches.', '4. Suggest that you like her. Only do this if you actually do like her and if you get the sense that she likes you back. This is a blunt move which can seem daunting, but if you like the girl and are fairly certain she might like you back, a bold approach which could open the door to you asking her out on a date with the certainty that she likes you back.\nYou can let her know you’re interested by saying something like “I really like having you as a friend, but I’d love to be more than friends.”\nDon’t tell her you like her if you are just looking to satisfy your curiosity about her interest in you. This can be hurtful and can sever her trust in you.', '5. Ask her out. If you like the girl but aren’t sure if she likes you back, you can test the waters by saying “I’ve been hearing great things about this movie,___. Would you like to come see it with me?” Keep the tone casual. If she says yes, you’ll know she’s interested. If she says no, you can change the conversation to something else.', ""6. Be receptive to her signals. Back off if you get the sense that she actually doesn’t like you or engage in a flirty banter if you sense there is mutual interest. \nIf the girl you like objects to your romantic advances, even when you thought she liked you back, don't take it personally. A good relationship starts with a strong mutual connection. Moreover, there are plenty of other girls who will be right for you."", '7. Avoid overanalyzing. Trying to figure out whether a girl likes you can be all-consuming and distracting. Over-analyzing her behavior may result in your becoming obsessed with simply ""winning her over"" rather than getting to know her as a person.\nRather than investing tons of time in determining whether or not she likes you, take opportunities every now and then to spend time with her and her friends. Just make sure to make your intentions relatively clear (via subtle flirting), or else you may become permanently ""friend-zoned.""']"

Cars & Other Vehicles,"[""1. Check your brake pads before you make any adjustments. The brake pads are the pads that clamp down on the front tire of your bike when you pull the brake lever. If the brake pads are worn down past the line labeled “wear line,” you’ll need to replace them before you make adjustments to your brakes.\nIf the wear lines on your brake pads aren't labeled, they should be marked by grooves on the side of the pads instead.\nYou can order new brake pads online or pick some up at your local bike shop."", ""2. Squeeze the brake lever to see where the pads hit the rim. Both brake pads should be coming into contact with the rim of the front tire at the same time. They should be hitting the center of the rim, with an equal amount of space above and below the pad. If the pads are hitting the rim too high or low, they could come into contact with the rubber part of the tire or the spokes on the bike.\nCrouch down to get a good look at the brake pads as you're squeezing the brake lever."", '3. Use an Allen wrench to loosen the bolts holding the brake pads in place. Turn the Allen wrench counterclockwise to loosen the bolts. Don’t loosen the bolts all the way or the brake pads will come out of the brake pad holder.', '4. Move the brake pads up or down in the brake pad holder. They should easily move up and down once the bolts are loosened. If the pads were too low on the rim, move them up until they’re centered. If the pads were too high on the rim, move them down until they’re centered.', '5. Re-tighten the brake pad bolts with the Allen wrench. Keep turning the Allen wrench clockwise until the bolts are fully tightened. Check to make sure the brake pads are centered. Readjust if needed.', '1. Test the tightness of your cables by pulling each brake lever. When you pull the brake levers, they should be about 1 ½ inches (3.8 cm) away from the grip on the handlebars. If the levers hit the handlebars when you pull them, the brake cables are too loose.', '2. Loosen the barrel adjusters for minor brake cable adjustments. If your brake cables are just slightly loose, loosening the barrel adjusters might fix the problem. The barrel adjusters are located where the brake cables meet the brake levers.\nLoosen the barrel adjuster attached to the loose brake cable by turning it counterclockwise. Loosening the barrel adjuster will actually slightly tighten the brake cable.\nAfter you loosen the barrel adjuster, pull the brake lever to see if it fixed the problem. If the brake cable is still too loose, you’ll need to adjust it on the caliper. Leave the barrel adjuster as it is. Don’t tighten it yet.', '3. Unscrew the bolt holding the brake cable on the caliper. The caliper is the main frame of the brakes that the brake pads are attached to. The brake cable is the thin cable extending off the caliper. Locate the bolt that’s holding the brake cable. Use an Allen wrench to turn it counterclockwise a few times until the bolt is slightly loose.\nDon’t unscrew the bolt all the way. Just rotate the Allen wrench counterclockwise 2-3 times until the bolt is loose.', ""4. Pull the brake cable outward to tighten it. Now that the bolt is loosened, you shouldn’t have any problem pulling the cable. Hold it in place with your fingers once you’ve pulled it taut. As you pull the cable, the brake pads should tighten on the rim of the front tire. You want them to be tight enough that there’s some resistance when you turn the tire, but not so tight that the tire isn’t able to turn at all.\nIf you can't turn the tire at all, pull less hard on the brake cable so it's not as tight."", '5. Tighten the bolt holding the brake cable on the caliper. Use the Allen wrench and turn it clockwise 2-3 times until it won’t turn anymore. The cable should be secure in place once the bolt is tightened.', '6. Tighten the barrel adjusters on the handlebars. Turn the barrel adjusters you loosened before clockwise several times until they’re fully tightened. Tightening the barrel adjusters will loosen the brake pads that are clamped onto the front tire.

When you pull the levers now, there should be 1 ½ inches (3.8 cm) between the lever and the grip on the handlebars.']"
Home and Garden,"['1. Find a plant that looks appealing to you. Don’t just pick the first bamboo plant you find, but look for a healthy one. You can find Lucky Bamboo plants at your local garden center or nursery, and even some grocery stores.\nIt may be labeled one of the following ways: Lucky Bamboo, Ribbon Plant, or occasionally by its true name, Dracaena sanderiana.', '2. Pick one that’s a vibrant green color. Caring for a Lucky Bamboo plant isn’t very hard, but if you get one that isn’t healthy, it will be much harder to care for and it may die. The size of the plant doesn’t matter too much here, as most of them will be fairly small.\nIt should be an even green color all over with no blemishes, bruises, or yellowing.\nThe stalks should be a consistent color from the base to their tops.\nThere also shouldn’t be any browning on the tips of the leaves.', '3. Make sure it’s been planted properly and doesn’t smell. Lucky Bamboo plants are very resilient, but if they have been planted incorrectly or have a sour odor, they could be sick, and won’t grow.\nBamboo plants don’t have a fragrance like flowers do, but if they haven’t been watered properly, they can grow bacteria and develop a stink.\nCheck the current water levels, and check to see if it has soil or fertilization. Many bamboo plants are grown hydroponically, just in water with small rocks or pebbles to hold the stalks in place. Some may be in soil, however, check to make sure that it is at least half full of water, or the soil is moist, but not soaked.', '1. Decide between water or soil. There are advantages to both options depending on how much you are prepared to care for it. Too much soil or fertilization can actually harm your plant. However, if you are using tap water and it has fluoride and other chemicals, you may want to use soil and fertilizer to prevent yellow tips.\nIf you are growing it in standing water, you will need some pebbles to hold it upright. If in soil, try mixing a third each of sand, peat moss, and regular soil to ensure excellent drainage.\nFor water only, make sure that your plant has at least enough to cover the base of the roots. You should also change the water at least once per week to prevent the plant from rotting. It is a good idea to rinse the vase, pebbles, and plant each time you do this.\nIf you are growing the plant in soil, water the plant just enough so that the soil is moist.', '2. Choose the right container. Your pot should be about 2 inches (5 cm) larger in diameter than the plant. Most Lucky Bamboo plants already come in a pot, but you can use your own pot to make the plant more your own.\nA clear container works well for water and will show off your plant and pebbles, but make sure that you keep it out of direct sunlight.\nYou can also use a ceramic pot and grow it in either pure water or in soil. If you use soil, plant the bamboo in a pot with a drain hole.', '3. Add a very light fertilizer periodically for quicker growth. Too much fertilizer is worse than none at all, so use it sparingly. This is especially true of potted plants because the fertilizer will not become diluted by rain and can’t run off like it will for plants in the ground.', '1. Water sparingly. Your lucky Bamboo plant doesn’t need a lot of water. In fact, too much is bad for it.\nWater your plant about once a week and ensure that there’s a few inches at all times, enough to cover the roots.\nIf you have soil in your pot, make sure that it’s not too moist or dry. Your bamboo plant can live well in just water, so over soiling or fertilizing can actually harm it.', '2. Keep your plant out of direct sunlight. Lucky Bamboo in the wild is usually shaded from direct sunlight by other, taller plants. You should keep your plant in an open, and bright area, but one that isn’t exposed to direct sunlight all day.\nTo best care for your Lucky Bamboo, keep it away from windows that get a lot of light. Instead, place it in a part of your room not so exposed.\nYour Lucky Bamboo plant will also grow best in temperatures between in 65°F and 90°F.', '3. Arrange your stalks. If you wish to style the Lucky Bamboo plant, choose a few prime stalks to make a linked arrangement and put it on display. You can manipulate the stalks to grow around each other or curl with a bit of work; to do this you have to use younger stalks that haven’t grown a lot and hardened yet.\nYou can simply plant your stalks in a line or rows if you want straight stalks.\nTo curl your Lucky Bamboo plant, get a cardboard box and cut off the bottom and one side. Place the box over your plant with the open end facing your light source. Your stalks will begin to curl towards the light as they grow. Once you see a bend, rotate your plant.\nYou can also wrap some wire around younger stalks crisscrossing them. As they grow you will add more wire to keep them stable as they intertwine.', '4. Remove dead or yellow leaves. Sometimes the ends of your leaves might turn yellow. This could be caused by a few factors: you plant isn’t getting enough water, there’s too much soil or fertilizer, or too much direct sunlight. You can trim off the yellow parts, or remove the whole leaf.\nTo remove the yellowed tips of your leaves, sterilize a pair of pruning shears or sharp scissors and with light rubbing alcohol or vinegar, then cut the yellow part off following the natural shape of the leaf.\nYou can remove whole leaves by simply pulling them down off the stalk at the base of the leaf.', '5. Propagate your plant. When one or two of your stalks gets too tall you can cut them and replant them. This will help you care for your Lucky Bamboo plant by ensuring that it doesn’t get too crowded and can produce new plants.\nTake your longest stalk and remove the smaller leaves at the top of the shoot.\nWith a sterile knife or scissors, cut the shoot so at least two nodes, which are the raised part of the stem, are on the new cutting.\nPlace the shoot in a bowl of clean, distilled water. Keep it in a shady area for about one to two months until it begins to sprout roots. Once you see roots, you can replant it the same pot as your bamboo plant.', '6. Tie the stalks in place with ribbon wire or other ribbon. People often tie a gold or red ribbon around the stalks of Lucky Bamboo plants to hold them together, and as an extra symbol of good fortune.\nAdd pebbles to finish off the look and hold the arrangement in place.\nPlace your Lucky Bamboo plant somewhere where you will enjoy it and remind you to care for it.']"
Hobbies and Crafts,"['1. Crease a piece of letter-sized paper in half lengthwise. Get a piece of printer paper that’s 8 ⁄2 in × 11 in (22 cm × 28 cm) and lay it on a flat surface. Fold the paper in half lengthwise so the paper looks like a long rectangle. Crease the fold with your fingernail before unfolding the paper again.\nIf you want to make a colored paper airplane, use construction paper instead.', '2. Bring the top corners toward the center crease. Once the paper is flat again, grab one of the top corners and fold it toward the crease you just made to form a triangle. Press along the fold with your fingernail so the fold stays in place. Repeat the fold along the other top corner so the top of your paper forms a point.\nMake sure the crease points toward you when you’re folding your paper airplane or else you’ll fold the wrong corners.', '3. Fold the angled top edges toward the crease again. Grab the new top corner on one side of your paper and fold toward the crease to form a long triangle. Run your fingernail across the fold to secure it in place. Fold the other top corner in the same way so your piece of paper looks like a large triangle.\nTip: Try using a ruler or a credit card to press the fold down if pressing it with your fingernail doesn’t work.', '4. Fold the paper along the centerline. Use the first crease you made as a guide for making your next fold. Fold the airplane in half along the crease so the triangles you made are on the inside. Slide your fingernail across the crease so the fold stays in place.\nThis fold creates the bottom of your plane so it’s easier to hold and throw once it’s finished.', '5. Crease the angled side toward the center fold to create the wings. Bring the angled side of the paper to the fold you just made down the middle. Crease the paper with your knuckle or fingernail. Flip the paper airplane over to create the wing on the other side. Once both sides are creased, unfold them slightly so the plane is flat on top.\nMake sure your wings are symmetrical to one another so your plane stays level when you throw it.', '1. Crease an 8 ⁄2 in × 11 in (22 cm × 28 cm) piece of paper in half lengthwise. Use a piece of printer or construction paper for your paper airplane. Lay the paper on a flat surface and fold it in half lengthwise to create a long rectangle. Press down on the crease with your fingernail before unfolding the paper again.\nTry using different kinds of paper to add designs and test how it affects your plane.', '2. Bring the top corners toward the crease in the middle. Grab one of the top corners and fold it into a triangle so the edge lines up with the crease. Flatten the fold using your knuckle or fingernail so it holds in place. Repeat your fold on the other top corner so there’s a point at the top of your paper.\nMake sure the crease you folded is pointing toward you when you start folding the paper, or else your folds won’t line up.', '3. Fold the top point down so there’s ⁄2 in (1.3 cm) left on the bottom. Grab the top point of your paper and fold it down to hide the triangles you just made. Bring the point down until it’s ⁄2 in (1.3 cm) from the bottom of the sheet. Run your knuckle over the fold to secure it in place. Your piece of paper should look like an envelope.\nDon’t let the point touch the bottom edge of your paper or it will affect the structure of your plane when you’re finished.', '4. Bring the top corners toward the center. Grab one of the new corners you just made at the top of your paper. Fold the corner over so the edge lines up with the middle crease. Secure your fold by running your knuckle over it. Repeat the fold on the other side so there are 2 triangles.\nIf you want your airplane to have a blunt edge in front instead of a point, fold the top of your paper so only the corners touch the center crease.', ""5. Hold your folds in place by folding the bottom point over them. Crease the point closest to the bottom of your paper so it covers the 2 right angles along the center of your paper. Make sure the fold holds the triangles in place.\nYour paper should look like a large triangle on top of a narrow rectangle when you're finished."", '6. Fold the paper in half along the center crease. Fold your plane in half the opposite way as your initial fold. Keep the previous folds you made on the outside so you can still see the triangles. Press along the fold with your knuckle to flatten it.\nDon’t hide your previous folds inside or else it will affect your plane’s structure.', '7. Crease the wings down so they line up on the bottom edge. Take the angled edge of the plane and fold it toward the crease you just made. Flip your plane over and repeat the fold on the other side to make the second wing. Unfold the wings so the top of your plane is flat so it can fly easily.\nMake sure the wings on your plane are the same size so your plane doesn’t fly to one side.']"
Computers and Electronics,"['1. Talk about mutual interests. Chances are you want to talk to this girl on Facebook because there’s something you like about her. Talk about your mutual interests to connect with her on a deeper level.\nYou could say, “I saw you’re wearing a Ramones T-shirt in your profile photo. I love them too. What’s your favorite album?”', '2. Ask her about herself. Most people enjoy talking about themselves, and everyone appreciates a good listener. Ask the girl questions to get to know her better.Asking Friendly QuestionsCheck out her profile for things she likes. Look for places she’s been, bands, movies, or sports she likes, or foods she enjoys. Think about questions you could ask about her different interests, like “I’ve never been to Italy! What was your favorite city?” or “I’m not a huge baseball fan, but maybe you can talk me into it.”Keep your tone light and friendly. If you’re starting a conversation for the first time, begin with a friendly greeting. You could say, “Hey, this is a little random, but I saw you posted a picture from Yosemite and I’ve been wanting to go for forever! How was it?”Avoid asking anything too personal. You’re still getting to know each other, so avoid talking about personal or sensitive topics, like religion, sex, politics, and money.', '3. Keep conversations on the shorter side. In the beginning, it may make sense to keep Messenger conversations shorter rather than longer. A conversation that goes on and on may feel uncomfortable to her if you don’t know each other well. Get to know one another gradually over multiple messages to build friendship in a natural way.', '4. Ask about an assignment or schedule to open a message. Messenger sends private messages between you and the girl you’re trying to chat with. Your messages won’t be subject to the comments and likes of other people, but it will feel a little more personal. If you’re unsure how to begin, open the conversation by asking about something perfunctory rather than personal. This doesn’t mean that a personal conversation can’t follow, but it puts less pressure on getting the conversation started.\n\nYou could say, “Hey, do you know what the English homework is for tomorrow? I forgot to write it down,” or “What time does our shift at the restaurant begin tomorrow, again?”', '5. Use a conversation starter. Conversation starters are open-ended questions that allow you to get to know someone better. These don’t have to be particularly loaded or customized. They are just to break the ice. If you’ve been writing on each other’s Facebook wall posts already, you could even follow up on something she’s posted about. Quick Conversation Starter TipsKeep it simple: Start off with an easy, relaxed greeting, like “Hey, what’s up?” Then she can decide how much she wants to say in response, which lets her feel comfortable and in control.See what she’s posted recently. Check her wall to see if she’s been up to anything that you could talk about, like seeing a popular movie or taking a cool vacation. For example, you could say, “I don’t even like country music, but that concert looked really fun!”More conversation starters: “I haven’t seen you in so long. How’ve you been?” “So, what are you up to this weekend?”“I need a movie recommendation! What have you seen lately?”', '6. Draw on joint activities. It’s likely you and the girl you’d like to chat with know each other through something you both already do. Try talking about joint activities like classes or work you already have in common. Drawing on shared experiences will bring you closer.\n\nYou could say, “I really liked that drill we did at practice today. You ran so fast!” or “That customer at the store today was hilarious. Did she really think we made cupcakes at a hot dog place?”', '7. Respect her boundaries. If the girl you’re chatting with blocks you or asks you not to contact her anymore, respect her wishes. She may not be interested in the type of relationship you’re seeking right now.', '1. Make a joke on her wall. If you don’t know the girl very well, it makes sense to first interact with her publicly on her wall. This type of interaction is a bit more casual, but whatever you say or share may be subject to the comments and likes of others, so keep that in mind. To get a conversation going, try making a good-natured joke about something she’s posted. This shows that you are engaged with what she’s interested in and that you have a sense of humor.\nKeep your jokes clean and don’t try to tear down any other comments with yours.\nIf she likes or comments positively on your post, that is a good sign. You could try progressing to a private message, if she’s receptive to your wall posts.', '2. Share pictures on her wall. Photos are a good way to reinforce a connection with someone you like. If you have photos together from a day at work or school trip, you could post them and tag her. You could also share a funny photo that is not of the two of you but appropriate to a post she makes, such as a meme, to make her laugh.Choosing the Perfect Photo and CaptionOn a funny photo: Be a little silly with your caption. You can write, “Had to share this gem of a photo,” or “We both look so great in this…”. If you’re making a funny face in the photo, say something like, “What you don’t know is that I look like this all the time!”On a cute photo: You can be sweet, and a little understated. Try something like “You look okay in this one, I guess ;)”, “This was a pretty good day…” or “Let’s do this again sometime…?”On a meme: A good meme should speak to an inside joke that you have together, or something that reminds you of her. If it’s really funny, you might not even need a caption! If you want to add one anyways, try something short like, “Couldn’t resist sharing this,” or “This reminds me of a certain someone…”', '3. Reinforce inside jokes when possible. If you and the girl you’re trying to chat with have any inside jokes, post one on her wall. Inside jokes are good because they don’t tire out quite as easily as other jokes. Posting one (even if it was created in a larger group) will make her smile and cement a bond between you.', '4. Be kind. In all your Facebook wall interactions, strive to be kind. It can be hard to read sarcasm online. If your tone is difficult to discern, she may interpret your posts as critical, even if that’s not how you mean them.\n\nPhrases to avoid might include, “I’m not rude; I just say what everyone else is thinking.”']"
Family Life,"['1. Use a hole punch to make holes in 2 small paper cups. Punch 2 holes in each cup. Make the holes close to the rim of the cups and on opposite sides.\nIf you don’t have paper cups, you can make the buckets for your balance scale with plastic cups instead.', ""2. Cut 2 pieces of twine that are each around 1 foot (0.30 m) long. Any kind of twine will work, but a thick, strong twine will make the balance scale more durable. After you cut the twine pieces, lay them next to each other to make sure they’re the same length. If they're not, cut them with scissors to adjust their lengths."", '3. Tie the ends of the twine through the holes in the cups. Use 1 piece of twine per cup. When you’re finished, the twine pieces should form thin handles on the cups, like the cups are little buckets.', '1. Find a notched clothes hanger. A plastic, metal, or wooden hanger will work, as long as it has a notch on both sides of the hook. Otherwise, the paper buckets will slip and fall right off the scale.\nIf you don’t have a notched clothes hanger, you can use some more twine to tie the handles on the paper buckets to the bottom of a regular clothes hanger so they don’t fall off.', ""2. Hang the buckets on the clothes hanger using the twine handles. Hang the cups on opposite sides of the clothes hangers in the notches. When you're finished, lift up the scale and hold it by the top to examine the buckets. Both buckets should be hanging at the same level — if one is higher than the other, you'll need to adjust the twine handles."", ""3. Let your kids decorate the buckets on their new balance scale. Put out stickers, markers, and crayons and let your kids personalize the scale. They'll enjoy playing and learning with it more if they get to add their own personal touch.\nOne way to decorate the scale is to help your kids write their names on it.\nDon't attach anything too heavy to the buckets or it could interfere with how the scale works."", '1. Hang your balance scale on a doorknob. Doorknobs are great to hang balance scales from because they’re low enough for kids to reach them. If you can’t find a doorknob to use, look for any kind of handle or bar you can hook the clothes hanger onto.', '2. Help your kids look for objects to put on the scale. Any kind of object will work, as long as it’s small enough to fit in the paper buckets you made. Some fun objects you could try weighing are:\nYour kids’ favorite small toys.\nDifferent rocks that your kids find outside.\nSmall fruits like strawberries, blueberries, and grapes.', '3. Have the kids experiment putting the different objects in the cups. When the object in 1 cup weighs more than the object in the other cup, the heavier cup will sink and tip the scale. Explain to your kids that the lower bucket has the heavier object, and the higher bucket has the lighter object.']"
Education and Communications,"['1. Say ""Sameach"" for ""happy."" In Hebrew, the idea of happiness is expressed with the word ""Simcha.""

In Hebrew phrases, the words in a sentence aren\'t always in the same order that they are in English. In this case, the adjective comes after the noun, so ""Happy Passover"" is actually ""Pesach Sameach"".\nTo pronounce the whole phrase, just put the pronunciations above together: ""PAY-sock sah-MEY-akh."" Congratulate yourself for learning a new Hebrew phrase!', '1. Optionally, put ""chag"" at the start of ""Pesach sameach."" ""Chag"" is the traditional Hebrew word for ""festival"" from scripture. Saying ""chag Pesach sameach"" is basically like saying, ""Happy Passover Festival!"" This isn\'t really any better or worse than the basic phrase above — just different.\n""Chag"" is pronounced ""KHAHG."" It\'s similar to the English word ""cog,"" with the same breathy, raspy sound described above used for the c.\nSome sources suggest that ""chag"" is used especially by Sephardic Jews.', '2. Drop ""Pesach"" for ""Chag Sameach."" Literally, this means ""Happy festival."" It\'s a little like saying ""Happy holidays"" in English.\nYou can use this for most Jewish holidays, but it\'s best of all for Passover, Sukkot, and Shavu\'ot, which are technically the only religious festivals. Chanukah and other days of celebration are technically holidays.', '3. Use ""Chag kasher v\'sameach"" to impress. This is a somewhat fancy way of wishing someone a happy holiday. The rough meaning is, ""Have a happy and kosher holiday."" Here, you\'re referencing the Jewish concept of Kashrut (religious dietary laws).\nThis phrase is pronounced ""KHAGH kah-SHEHR vuh-sah-MEY-akh."" ""Chag"" and ""sameach"" are pronounced the same as above. ""Kasher"" uses a light r sound pronounced at the very back of the mouth — almost like a French r. Don\'t forget to add a very quick v sound before ""sameach.""', '4. Try ""Chag Kashruth Pesach"" for a Passover-specific greeting. The meaning here is similar to the phrase above: ""Have a happy kosher Passover."" The difference is that this phrase specifically mentions Passover, while the one above is used for many holidays.\nYou can pronounce ""kashruth"" as ""kash-ROOT"" or ""kash-RUTH"" — both are acceptable. In either case, use the tip of your tongue to make a light r sound. This is quite similar to the Spanish r sound.', '5. Use ""Happy Pesach"" if you want to cheat. Can\'t handle the tricky Hebrew pronunciations in this article? Try this ""Henglish"" alternative. Though it\'s not exactly a traditional holiday greeting, many English-speaking Jews use this as a convenient ""shortcut"" during Passover.']"
Food and Entertaining,"['1. Cut the celery stalks from the base to make room for new stalks to grow. Using a long, sharp knife, cut the celery stalks about 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 2 inches (5.1 cm) from the base. This will provide room for new stalks to grow without removing the necessary nutrients.\nThoroughly clean the cut celery stalk base with water and pat dry with a paper towel or cloth.\nMake sure that you have cleaned the celery stalk base well and have cleaned the stalk of any dirt, debris, or bugs.', '2. Put the celery stalk base in a 2 inches (5.1 cm) to 3 inches (7.6 cm) deep bowl partially filled with warm water. Using warm water will stimulate the growth of the new celery stalks. Place the cut and cleaned celery stalk base in a bowl with the bottom of the plant down and the recently cut portion facing up.\nMake sure that the bowl you use is clean and deep enough to hold several ounces of water without spilling over.\nFill the bowl with enough water so that about 2/3 of the celery stalk base is submerged, approximately .5 inches (1.3 cm) to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) depending on the size of your celery stalk base.', '3. Store the celery stalk base in the bowl in a sunny place for 5 to 7 days. It is crucial that your celery stalk base gets a lot of natural light. To generate the energy it needs to grow, your celery stalk will need an average of about six to seven hours of natural light per day.\nIf you do not have a place indoors that receives enough natural light, you can learn how to use grow lights. This will help you re-create the conditions necessary for your celery to grow.', '4. Change the water regularly. As your celery stalk begins to grow, it will absorb a significant amount of the water surrounding the stalk. It is important that you replenish the water so that your celery can continue to flourish.\nCheck the water level in the bowl containing your celery stalk daily. Top off the water in the bowl as needed so that 2/3 of your celery stalk remains submerged.\nChange the water every 2 to 3 days. This will ensure that your celery stalk has the clean water it needs to grow tall and strong.', '1. Check your celery for signs that it is ready to be transplanted. After 5 to 7 days, your celery stalk base should have begun to grow new shoots and should be ready to transfer into a pot with soil. There are a few signs that indicate that your celery stalk is ready to be transplanted.\nThe outside of the celery stalk base should have begun to brown and break down. While the appearance may be concerning, this is a normal and essential part of the growth process. The old celery stalk breaks down in order to create natural nutrients for the new stalk to grow. \nTiny sprouts of new growth have begun to spring up. This is a sure sign that the celery stalk is producing new growth and is ready to be transplanted.', '2. Fill about 2/3 of the planting pot with high quality general use potting soil. You will want to use your own judgement here, as the exact amount of potting soil needed will vary depending on the size of your celery stalk.\nThe size of the planting pot will also vary depending on how wide your celery stalk base is. On average, a celery stalk base is about 4 inches (10 cm) wide. To allow room for the celery to grow, you will likely want to choose a planting pot that is at least 6 inches (15 cm) wide and 5 inches (13 cm) tall.\nThe goal is to fill the pot with enough soil so that you can add more around and on top of the celery stalk base so that only the new sprouts are sticking out.', '3. Plant the celery stalk in the potting soil. Gently lift your celery stalk out of the bowl and place it in the center of your planting pot on top of the potting soil. Adding just a little at a time, slowly cover the original celery stalk base with new soil, leaving only the new celery shoots sticking out at the top.', '4. Water your new celery plant generously. While you want to be careful not to overwater your plant, it is crucial that your celery plant continues to get plenty of water so that it can continue to flourish. While there is no steadfast rule about how often you should water your celery plant, there are a few ways to ensure that your plant is getting the water it needs.\nCheck if the soil is dry. If there is little moisture to the touch, your plant probably needs to be watered.\nExamine the growing celery for deterioration, yellowing, or brown spots. If any of these are present, your celery is not getting the water it needs. Celery requires a lot of water to grow strong, so if your new growth shoots appear discolored, dry, or small, water more often or use a spray bottle daily.', '5. Watch as your celery stalk grows into a new celery plant. With the proper amount of sunlight and water, your celery stalk will grow into a new celery plant that can be harvested, eaten, and enjoyed!\nUsually, it takes about 5 months from the time that you first cut the original celery stalk for the new plant to grow completely.\nAfter you have harvested your new celery plant, you can repeat this process and grow more celery at no additional cost.']"
Hobbies and Crafts,"['1. Shuffle the cards and deal 7 cards to each player. Get out a pack of Uno cards and shuffle all 108 cards. Then deal 7 cards to each person who wants to play. Direct the players to keep their cards face down.\nYou can play Uno with 2 to 10 players. Players should be at least 7 years old.', '2. Put the rest of the Uno cards in the center of the table. Keep the cards face down in a stack. These cards will make the draw pile which players will take from throughout the game.', ""3. Turn over the top card from the draw pile to start the game. Place the top card from the draw pile next to the draw pile, but leave it facing up. You'll use this card to start the game and it will become the discard pile."", ""4. Play a card to match the color, number, or symbol on the card. The player to the left of the dealer should lay down a card from their hand if it matches the color, number, word, or symbol on the card that's lying face up in the center of the table. Direct them to put their card on top of the discard pile. The next player then looks for a card from their hand that they can play.Tip: If the player has a Wild card, they can use it at any time.\n\nFor example, if the top card in the discard pile is a red number 8, you could play any red card you have or a card of any color that has an 8 on it.\nThe game is usually played going clockwise from the dealer."", ""5. Draw a card from the draw pile if you can't play a card. If it's your turn and you don't have any cards that match the color, number, or symbol on the top card, take a card from the draw pile to add to your hand. You can play this card immediately if it matches some aspect of the card on the table.\nIf you can't play the card you just drew, the player next to you can take their turn."", '6. Pay attention to action and Wild cards. In addition to basic Uno cards that have numbers on them, there are 3 types of action cards. If you play a Wild card, you choose the color for the next play. If you put down a Draw 2, the player next to you must take 2 cards, and their turn is skipped. If you play Reverse, you change the direction of play, so the person who went before you will then have another turn.Did You Know? Playing a Wild Draw 4 card is like playing a standard Wild card, but it makes the next player draw 4 cards and skip their turn as well.\n\nA Reverse card has 2 arrows that are going in opposite directions.\nIf you get a Skip card, which is a card that has a circle with a slash through it, the player next to you must skip their turn.', '7. Say ""Uno"" if you only have 1 card left. Keep taking turns until 1 player has just 1 card left in their hand. At that point, the player must say ""Uno,"" or they\'ll be penalized if another player calls them out.\nIf someone forgets to say ""Uno,"" hand them 2 cards as a penalty. If no one notices that the player didn\'t say ""Uno,"" there is no penalty.', '8. Play your last card to win the hand. Once you\'re down to one card (and you\'ve already called ""Uno""), wait until the gameplay goes around the table and comes back to you. If you can play your last card before anyone else goes out, you\'ll be the winner of the round!\nIf you can\'t play your last card, draw another card and continue until someone\'s hand is empty.\nTry to save a Wild card as your last card, if you have one. That way, you\'ll know for sure that you\'ll be able to play it and win the round!', ""9. Tally the points in each player's hand at the end of each round.  The person who won the round gets points by adding up the cards in the remaining players' hands. Keep track of points for each round and keep playing rounds until a person scores 500 points. That person is the winner of the game. \nTo score a hand, give the winner of the round:20 points for each Draw 2, Reverse, or Skip card in an opponent's hand\n50 points for Wild and Wild Draw 4 cards\nThe face value for number cards (for example, an 8 card equals 8 points)\n\nYou can also count the number of cards a player has after each round and have the player that reaches 100 points first win, though this isn't in the official game rules."", ""1. Play Uno online or on a gaming system. Don't worry if you can't find people to play Uno with you in person! You can easily do an internet search in order to play Uno online. If you prefer, purchase Uno to play on your PC or gaming system, such as a PS4 or Xbox One.\nYou can even personalize the rules to create completely unique Uno games."", ""2. Play double cards to make the game end faster. To do a quick moving game of Uno, have every player put down 2 matches instead of 1 if they have them. This means everyone will go through cards quicker.Tip: Since you'll go through more cards, consider making the winning score at least 1,000 points instead of 500.\n\nFor example, if there's a yellow 3 on the table, a player could put down a yellow 7 and a red 3.\nIf you don't want the game to end faster, you can have the players draw 2 cards instead of 1 each time they don't have a card to play."", ""3. Customize your own Wild cards. If you're playing with a newer deck of Uno cards, you'll probably see 3 customizable Wild cards included. To play with these blank Wild cards, write down your own rules that everyone agrees to. Then you can play them as you would other Wild cards. For example, a customizable rule could be:\nEveryone must draw 2 cards.\nThe next player must sing a song or draw a card.\nSwap 1 card with the player next to you."", ""4. Swap hands with another player if you get the Swap Hands card. This is another newer card that Uno now includes in the deck. Play the Wild Swap Hands card like a Wild card, but decide which player you'd like to swap hands with.\nFor example, if you have this card, wait until the game is almost over and swap hands with the player that has the fewest cards.""]"
Home and Garden,"[""1. Buy sunflower seeds for growing. You can buy sunflower seeds from your local nursery or garden center, or you can order them online. If you want rarer varieties, you may have better luck online. Dwarf varieties are best-suited for container growing.\nSunflower seeds are also sold in grocery and convenience stores, but these are for eating, not for growing. After being roasted, a sunflower seed won't sprout.\nIf you already have a fully grown sunflower plant, put the seeds from the flower in an airtight container and keep them in the fridge. Try to plant the seeds as soon as possible. Older seeds may be harder to grow."", ""2. Choose your sunflower variety. A packet of sunflower seeds (or a listing on a website) will clearly state the name of the variety, the type of sunflower it is, and how tall the sunflower will grow. If you're shopping at a local nursery or garden center, you can also ask an associate for help.\nSingle-stem sunflowers only grow one flower from one seed. If you want to keep sunflowers all summer, you'll have to replant every 10 to 14 days. However, single-stem varieties are pollen-less, so they won't drop pollen on your porch, furniture, or clothes.\nBranching sunflowers produce many flowers over the course of the season without having to be replanted. Branching sunflowers also have some of the more unusual colors, including burgundy and chocolate."", ""3. Find the right size container. Choose the size of your container based on the height of the flower you want to plant, as well as how many flowers you want in each container. Generally, most dwarf sunflowers can be planted in a 12 to 16 in (30 to 41 cm) pot.\nMammoth sunflowers need a container that holds at least 5 gallons (19 L).\nIf you're repurposing a container that was previously used for something else, make sure it's clean and sterile. You may also have to make drainage holes in a repurposed container. Without them, your seeds may rot.\nInclude a plate or saucer under the container to catch run-off water."", ""4. Add potting soil and compost. Choose high quality, nutrient-rich topsoil or potting soil to plant your sunflowers. Mixing in compost provides a source of food for your sunflowers as well.\nQuality topsoil will have a pH of between 5.5 and 7.5, and have more than 3 percent organic content. These figures will be listed on the bag.\nAs long as you use high quality topsoil, you don't need to add any drainage material, such as sand or rocks, to the bottom of the container. Doing so actually hinders water movement and can prevent your pot from draining properly."", ""1. Push each seed about 1 inch (2.5 cm) into the soil. If you're planting more than one seed in your container, sow the seeds 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) apart.You may want to add a thin layer of compost to the top of the soil after your seeds are sown.\nMake sure you have a radius of 4 to 5 inches (10 to 13 cm) around all sides of each seed. Don't sow them too close to the edges of the container."", ""2. Water the seeds daily. Sunflowers need more water than most plants as they are growing. Make sure the soil remains moist and well-drained. Give your sunflowers at least 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water a week while the seeds are germinating.\nSunflowers that don't get enough water during these early stages will have thin, weak stems that are unable to hold the heavy flower head upright.\nYour soil is well-drained if water flows through it relatively quickly. Puddling or standing water in your pot indicates a drainage problem."", '3. Watch as the seeds germinate. Within a week to 10 days, your sunflower seeds should start growing into small seedlings. During this time, continue to water the seeds every day and make sure the soil is moist, particularly around the seeds.\nIf your sunflowers are outside, you may want to cover the seedlings with baskets or netting to protect them from birds.', ""1. Add fertilizer if desired. While sunflowers don't necessarily need additional feeding to grow, fertilizer can make the colors on your flower heads brighter and bolder. Start with a high-nitrogen liquid plant fertilizer, then switch to one with more phosphorus when the bud begins to bloom.\nYou can also add diluted fertilizer to your sunflower's water. Take care not to over-fertilize your sunflower – the stem may break."", '2. Keep your sunflower in direct sunlight. As the seedlings grow, they need as much direct sunlight as possible so the stems will be thick and strong and able to support the large flower head. Once grown, your sunflower should have 6 to 8 hours of direct sunlight a day.\nThe heliotropic heads of sunflowers follow the path of the sun. If not in direct sunlight, they will bend towards the sun, which may damage the stem over time.', '3. Water your sunflower several times a week. Expect to water your sunflowers more often than you do other plants. Check the soil every day or two – it should be constantly moist. Generally, give your sunflowers about 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water a week.\nIf your sunflowers are outside, they should be fine with rain water after they reach 1 to 2 feet (0.30 to 0.61 m) in height. You may need to compensate if you have a very hot, dry day.\nAs the flower grows, water the root zone in a 3 to 4 in (7.6 to 10.2 cm) radius around the plant itself.\nKeep a spray bottle handy and spritz the flower head with water regularly.', ""4. Stake your sunflower if necessary. Some dwarf varieties may not grow tall enough to need support. However, if your sunflowers reach a height of 3 feet (0.91 m) or taller, they should be anchored to something to keep the flower head from drooping.\nDon't anchor your support within the pot itself. When your sunflower reaches full size, it may tip the pot over. Tie the stake to a drainpipe, wall, or other object."", '5. Harvest the seeds. If you have a sunflower variety with edible seeds, let the flower die on the stem. The seeds will ripen and dry as well. If your sunflowers are outside, cover them with netting or a paper bag to keep the birds from eating all your seeds.\nGenerally, sunflower seeds that are black or gray with white stripes are edible.\nWhen the back of the flower head turns brown, the seeds are typically ready to harvest.\nOnce dried, you can keep the seeds in an air-tight container at room temperature for up to 4 months. You can also freeze them if you need them for longer.\nSunflower buds can be eaten as well. Blanch them first to remove bitterness, then steam or boil them for 3 minutes. They are delicious tossed in garlic butter.']"
Personal Care and Style,"[""1. Determine your hair type. A salon employee or online advice can help you find the characteristics of your hair. This will help you choose the right treatments and products. Here's the basic breakdown:\nWavy hair (type 2), generally thin and easy to handle\nCurly hair (type 3)\nCoily hair (type 4), usually very fragile and hard to grow out"", ""2. Wash your hair only when you must. Washing hair too often strips it of natural oils. Try washing it once a week. Switch to once every two or three weeks if your hair starts to break easily.\nTry to find a shampoo that doesn't leave your hair feeling too dry.\nTo reduce damage, wash hair in lukewarm water and rinse in cool water."", '3. Let hair dry on its own. The heat from blow drying can cause damage, leading your hair to break before it grows to the desired length. Instead, plait your hair, wrap it in a silk scarf, and let dry overnight. Alternatively, towel dry your hair by wrapping it in a towel and simply rubbing your head for a while.', '4. Use conditioner each time you wash. Shampoo strips your hair of natural oils. Restore these with conditioner suited for African hair. Periodically deep condition your hair as well.\nYou can use leave-in conditioner in between washes.', '5. Apply hair oil daily. Rub natural oil into the middle and ends of your hair to make it soft and supple. This will help prevent it breaking before it grows too long. Jamaican oil, castor oil, Moroccan oil, or lavender oil are all good options.\nCovering your hair with a satin scarf can help your hair take in the oil.', '6. Moisturize. Water strengthens dry hair and may stimulate your hair roots. You can apply water, moisturizing conditioner, or a mixture of half olive oil or half coconut oil. For extra moisture, apply each one, in that order. The oil will help seal in the moisture.\nIf you use gel or mousse in your hairstyle, try hair jam instead. This will hold your hair, then eventually melt into oils to add shine and moisture.', '7. Consider protein conditioner. These can strengthen some types of hair, but may damage dry hair. Try brushing your hair: if your strands stretch significantly before breaking, you may need more protein.\nDo not leave in protein conditioner longer than instructed on the label, or it may turn hard and brittle.', '8. Grease your scalp when dry. About every other day or when your scalp feels dry, apply coconut grease to the tip of your pointer finger. Apply at the top of your part and sweep back until all the grease has been applied.\nStop if you notice dandruff, as oil can feed the fungus that causes it.\nIf you have a perm, grease only once a week, or apply hot oil instead.', '9. Remove products with neutralizing shampoo. Once a month, use a neutralizing shampoo to clean all products out of your hair. If you use a lot of sprays, gels, and other styling products, use it every other week.', '1. Take vitamins. Vitamin supplements can give your hair the nutrients they need to grow faster and stronger.', '2. Eat enough protein. Eat food with plenty of protein, such as avocado, pumpkin seeds, or gelatin.', '3. Protect the ends of your hair. Leaving your hair down can make your hair vulnerable to breakage. Put your hair in a bun, braids, or other style the keeps your ends tucked away. Fasten your hairdo with bobby pins, since elastic bands can rip out your hair.', '4. Trim damaged hair. Trim the ends of your hair every two weeks, or whenever they start to split. If your hair is healthy, you may only need to remove 1–2 inches (2.5–5cm) every three or four months. It may seem odd to trim your hair to help it grow, but it really does help. Split ends rapidly lead to breakage, making it very hard to grow your hair out.\n\tEXPERT TIP\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtney Foster\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLicensed Cosmetologist\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourtney Foster is a Licensed Cosmetologist, Certified Hair Loss Practitioner, and Cosmetology Educator based out of New York City.

Hobbies and Crafts,"['1. Purchase T-shirt transfer paper. Transfer paper can be found anywhere you can buy stationary or printer paper. There are two types of transfer paper, one suitable for white or pastel shirts, and one suitable for all darker colors.\nMost transfer paper is the same size as your regular printer paper (Letter size or A4 depending on your country). Before purchasing an unusual size, make sure your printer can handle it.\nLight transfer paper is used for light or white shirts. \nDark transfer paper is used for any shirt that is darker.', '2. Select an image. You can use any image saved on your computer.\nIf you only have the image in a physical form, scan it and save it to your computer as a jpeg file. Alternatively, take a photograph and transfer it to your computer.', '3. Mirror the image for light-colored shirts. Transfer paper for light-colored paper creates a mirror image on your shirt. Look for a ""reverse"" or ""mirror"" setting in the print options window, or flip your image in MS Paint or another image editing program.  If you skip this step, all text in your design will be unreadable.\nDo not reverse the image if you are using transfer paper for darker shirts. This type of transfer paper transfers the image exactly as it appears.\nIf you\'re not sure whether the reverse setting worked, print out a test piece on ordinary paper. It should come out as the mirror image of the look you want.', '4. Print your design onto the paper. Before printing, check the preview to confirm that the image fits onto your paper. If it\'s too large, select ""fit to scale"" in the print options, or scale it down in an image editing program.\nWhen printing with your transfer paper, you need the right kind of printer like an Inkjet printer. \nIf the two sides of your transfer paper look different, print onto the blank side. One side may have a logo, design, or thermal indicators on it.\nSwitch to ""landscape mode"" if the image is wider than it is tall.', '5. Cut out the image. Any paper you leave around the image will show up as a thin film on the shirt. To create a clean image, cut out the image.\nTo get an accurate cut, use a ruler and an Exacto knife.', ""6. Cover a hard, flat surface with a cotton pillowcase. Clear a table or countertop, then clean and dry it if necessary. Lay a cotton pillowcase over this surface, covering enough space to lay out the area of your T-shirt you'll be printing.\nMost ironing boards are not suitable, due to the metal bars or grating on the surface.\nUse a surface that can withstand heat. Don't try to iron over a laminate countertop. A cutting board can also work."", '7. Set your iron. Check the instructions that came with your transfer paper to find out which settings work best for your product. If no advice is listed, select the ""cotton"" or high-temperature setting; select ""dry"" or turn off the steam; empty all water out of the iron. Give the iron a few minutes to warm up.\nFor best results, use an iron with at least 1200 watts of power.', '8. Iron the shirt. Place the shirt over the pillowcase. Iron it until it is completely flat. Any wrinkles will show up in the transferred image.\nWash and dry the T-shirt first if necessary.', '9. Place the paper onto the shirt. If using transfer paper for light shirts, place the image face down. If using transfer paper for dark shirts, place the image faceup. Line up the center of the image with the center of your T-shirt neckline.\nPlacing the image face down will allow the image to be transferred so that it’s not a mirrored image when it gets transferred to your shirt.', '10. Iron the image onto the shirt. Press the iron firmly over the clothing, pushing down with your whole hand for significant pressure.\nIron from 30 seconds to several minutes, according to the instructions that came with your specific transfer paper.\nKeep moving the iron and make sure to provide heat to every part of the paper.\nSome types of transfer paper have thermal indicators that will change colors when the area is hot enough.', '11. Let the area cool and then peel the paper off. Let it cool for at least a few minutes, until the paper reaches room temperature.\nPeel off the paper to reveal your image underneath.', '1. Select a black and white image. You need a black and white image because the black will block out the light allowing your design to show up on your silk screen.\nThis printing method can only print black images onto the shirt. If you have a color image in mind, convert it into black and white using Microsoft Word, Photoshop, or another photo editing application.', ""2. Print the image onto a transparency. You can purchase acetate paper from specialized screen printing supply stores, but clear transparency sheets from office supply stores work fine. Print the image onto the transparency sheet. \nLow-quality printers may not make the image completely opaque, which can lead to a messy image on the shirt. If necessary, take the transparencies to a copy store instead.\nSome transparency sheets will shrink or warp when they go through the printer. Buy a small pack to start with, so you can switch to a different brand if the first attempt doesn't work out."", '3. Paint a photo emulsion on a printing screen. These materials are available online or at large craft stores, often as part of a single screen printing kit. Paint both sides of the screen with the photo emulsion, using a squeegee to spread it a thin, even layer across the whole surface.\nWear gloves while handling the photo emulsion.\nYou also may want to lay a garbage bag down so that you don’t get any paint on your table or another surface.\nCover an area slightly larger than your photo and spread the emulsion out evenly. You shouldn’t be able to see through the screen.', '4. Dry the screen in a dark location. Leave the screen in a dark, cool area. Allow several hours for the photo emulsion to dry.\nOptionally, point a fan over the screen to speed up the drying process.', '5. Set up a light station. The photo emulsion allows you to ""burn"" an image onto your screen when exposed to light. Clear a space for the screen under a bright source of light. Direct outdoor sunlight can work in the late morning or early afternoon.\nPlace a black garbage bag or cloth under your screen for best results.\nAlternatively use a 150-watt incandescent bulb, or a specialized ""photo flood"" bulb for a shorter exposure time. \nYou can purchase a specialized image burning machine for faster results.', '6. Prepare the screen and image. Set this up before you remove the screen from the dark room. Place these items on top of each other in the following order:\nA large piece of cardboard or a large tray.\nA piece of black fabric, to reduce reflection.\nThe prepared screen with the flat side of the screen face up.\nThe transparency image, face down and attached to the screen with tape.\nA sheet of clear glass, Lucite, or Plexiglass.', '7. Expose the image at your light station. The timing of this step is tricky to get right on your first try since it varies based on the intensity of the light. Typically, the image is ready once the photo emulsion has changed to a dull grey-green.\nCheck your photo emulsion product for instructions, since the timing can vary from 2 to 90 minutes depending on light intensity.', '8. Wash the screen. Remove the glass and transparency and quickly bring the screen to the sink or a hose. Apply a powerful spray of cold water for several minutes to the recessed side of your screen. The ink on the transparency paper blocked light from reaching the photo emulsion, preventing it from hardening. Keep spraying until all of this wet emulsion has washed away, leaving an outline of your image.\nIf all of the emulsion washes away, try again with a longer light exposure.\nIf none of the emulsion washes away after several minutes, use a photo emulsion remover on the screen and try again with a shorter exposure.', '9. Print onto your shirts. The screen is now a reusable printing device. Transfer the image onto your shirt by:\nPlacing a piece of cardboard or another barrier inside the shirt, to prevent bleeding through to the other side.\nAdd a small dollop of screen printing ink to the top of the screen, and pull it across with a squeegee to form a thin layer. Go over this several times to ensure an even layer.\nLift the screen without moving it against the shirt.', '10. Heat set the shirt. Most screen printing inks need to be ironed onto the shirt at a hot, dry setting. Others may only require an hour in sunlight, or a quick run through an ultraviolet drying machine.\nCheck your ink label for specific instructions before you heat set.\nOnce the image has dried, your shirt is ready to wear!', '1. Lay your shirt on a flat surface and iron it. To get the best results, you should iron your shirt to smooth out any wrinkles that could mess up the ink transfer.\nInkodye works best with cotton shirts so be sure to set your iron to the cotton setting.\nIron the shirt until you’ve removed all wrinkles, especially on and around the area you plan to print on.\nUse a dry ironing method without steam.', '2. Insert a piece of foam core or cardboard into your shirt. Place the cardboard inside your shirt and smooth out the area again.\nCardboard works well because it’s flat and won’t let the ink bleed through to the other side of the shirt. Plus, when you’re done, you can just throw it away.', '3. Create a frame where you want to place the image. You can use a piece of cardboard or plastic frame that you’ve made or simply use blue painter’s tape to tape off the area.\nThe area inside your frame is where you’ll paint on the ink. The frame ensures that no ink gets outside of the area.\nIf you don’t want any extra inked area around your photo, use a frame that’s slightly smaller than your image. A smaller frame ensures that the ink won’t bleed out past your photo.\nMake sure not to tape the image down. It will get stuck. And run your fingernail along the taped edges if you used tape you ensure there are no gaps.', '4. Pour your Inkodye into a bowl. Make sure to shake the bottle well before pouring the ink.\nMake sure that your bowl isn’t absorbent, you don’t want the dye seeping into it.\nTry to do this in a ventilated room that isn’t exposed to a lot of natural light.\nAbout 2.5 tablespoons (40 ml) can coat an 11X11” cotton square.', '5. Apply the Inkodye to your shirt. Coat your brush or roller with the dye. Use the edges of your bowl to get excess dye of your brush so there’s not dripping or blotting.\nEvenly apply the dye to your desired area on your shirt. Don’t soak your shirt.\nInkodye is fairly colorless so pay close attention to how much you are applying.\nAfter you’ve covered the desired area, grab a paper towel and blot the area to soak up any excess dye.', '6. Remove the frame to see the painted area. Once you’ve covered the area you no longer need your frame.\nYou can keep the frame on if you used tape and you think some of the dye may have bled through.', '7. Place your negative on the inked part of the shirt. You can press down your negative onto your shirt to help it stick to the dyed area.\nSmooth out the area with your hand. You want your negative to make good contact everywhere with the dye.\nUse straight pins on the edges of your negative to keep it in place.\nAlternatively, you can place a piece of acetate over the top of your negative.', '8. Expose your print to direct sunlight. You now want to bring your shirt with the negative on it outside and let it soak up the sun to dry and transfer the image.\nExpose your print to direct sunlight for 10-15 minutes.\nIt’s best to do this when the sun is strongest around 11:00 am to 3:00 pm.\nYou may have to expose your print for longer if it’s cloudy out.\nAfter about five or so minutes you’ll begin to see the image darken.', '9. Remove the negative. It’s best to remove the negative in a space that isn’t very bright.\nRemoving the negative in subdued lighting will help to keep the print intact.', '10. Wash your shirt. It’s best to wash your shirt in the washing machine, but you can hand wash it as well.\nWashing will remove any extra Inkodye from your shirt and make your print look nice and fresh.\nUse warm to hot water for best results.\nYou may want to wash it twice to remove all the residue.\nAfter your shirt is clean, it’s ready to wear!']"
Education and Communications,"['1. Prepare a header section. The date should go in the upper right corner of the page. Skip one line below it and then type out your address, also justified to the right. Then, skip another line and place your recipient’s full address flush with the left hand side of the page.\nIf you are sending your request via email, you can omit the date and address portions and start with your salutation. However, make sure to use an effective and clear subject line. For example, if you are emailing a professor, your subject line might read, ""Mike Smith HIST 359 Paper Extension Request.""', '2. Employ a formal and full salutation. Start my typing “Dear” and then follow with their title and last name. For example, “Dear Mr. Brady” or “Dear Ms. Smith.” Some titles can be more complicated, such as “Dear Professor Montgomery” or “Dear Senator Smith.”\nEven if you know them informally, this is an official request so keep the tone and content formal. Do not write “Hi, Jim,” for example.\nTry to find some specific person that you can address your letter to. Otherwise, it can appear like a form letter. For example, “Dear Senator Smith,” is preferable to, “To Whom It May Concern.”', '3. Use a concise paragraph format. The body of your letter should be somewhere between 1-3 paragraphs. In many cases, you can open with 1-2 lines, explain your request in 2-4 lines, and conclude in 1-2 lines. If you need to expand to a full three paragraphs, simply separate the introduction, body, and conclusion.\nTo open your letter you might state, “I am John Smith a student in your HIST 456 MWF morning class.” This will jog your professor’s memory and save them time looking you up.', '4. Pay attention to your concluding remarks. Don’t disregard the importance of a solid conclusion. Use your final sentences to restate your case (in one line) and to thank them for their time. You might write, “I appreciate your consideration of my request.”\nIt is best to close with an official “sign off” before your name. Some of the better options are: “Sincerely” “Best” “All the Best” “Best Regards.”\nIf you need a reply by a certain time, you should include that information at this point as well. You can always pair it with your thanks. For example, “Thank you for your consideration and I look forward to hearing from you next week.” Just be careful not to appear overly pushy.', '5. Include your full name and signature. Below the “Sincerely,” leave 3-4 lines blank. Then, type your full name and justify it to the left. Use the blank space to sign your name in pen. If you plan to email your letter, you can delete those spaces and go directly to a typed name.', '1. Write the letter as soon as you can. As soon as you know you will need an extension, immediately begin preparing your letter. You need to give the recipient as much time as possible to make a decision about your situation. You also want to appear prepared, despite asking for an adjustment to the schedule.', '2. Determine how much extra time you will need. Consider all factors and submit a realistic request. If you ask for too little time, you may need to request another extension. Missing deadlines should be avoided whenever possible. So, it’s best to overestimate a little.\nDepending on the situation, you might need to consider your letter as part of an ongoing negotiation. In that sense, it is better to ask for a longer amount of time so that you can compromise and meet in the middle.\nGauge your pace based upon your current progress and what parts of the project have yet to be completed. For example, if you have worked on a consulting project for three months you should have a pretty good sense of how much is left to do.\nBe aware of the time constraints facing the recipient as well. They may be under their own deadlines that will now need to be pushed back. For example, college professors are often required to submit midterm grades and schedule their paper deadlines accordingly.', '3. Be aware of the existing rules. Verify the current deadline before you ask for it to be altered. You don’t want to appear disorganized by requesting an extension when you don’t understand the current situation. For example, some government entities require that you submit your request within 24 hours of initial contact with them. If this doesn’t work for you, then you can always cite the tight turn-around schedule.', '4. Include a sound explanation for your request. You are taking the time to craft the letter and your recipient will then take the time to read it, so make it worthwhile. Carefully consider your true reason for needing the extension and honestly convey this to your reader. Don’t lie or exaggerate as this will only hurt your case.\nA good reason might be the desire to be thorough or cautious in your work. For instance, if you are completing a project that could potentially impact the safety of others, pointing this fact out when asking for extra time could work in your favor.\nIf you have multiple reasons for your request, choose the best one and focus on it. For example, if you are delaying a job offer you might want to tell them that you would like to conduct additional research into the transfer costs (if this is indeed true) instead of letting them know that you are also waiting on another offer.', '5. Provide a few carefully chosen details as part of your request. Details will give your letter a sense of legitimacy and craftsmanship. This is especially important if you are submitting your letter to a government panel or some other group that you have never met personally.\nFor example, if your grandfather dies two days before your college essay is due, it is best to describe the incident as a “family emergency” as opposed to a general “emergency.” You may also want to mention his passing and some information about your travel arrangements.\nHave your paperwork in order before submitting any request. You may need to lay out a timeline of prior actions and applications, especially if dealing with the government or another official entity. Showing that you have followed all steps of the process up until this point can only work in your favor.', '6. Stay positive in tone and content. No one wants to read a letter that is one whiny line after another. Instead, describe negative events quickly and concisely and move on to the positive solution that you propose. For example, if you think that an initial salary offer is too low, you might write, ""I need more time to consider your offer. I do, however, think that a higher salary would allow me to do my job more efficiently.""', '7. Proofread your letter prior to submitting it. Give yourself at least a few minutes to read over your letter before you send it off. Look for editorial mistakes and typos. Run the grammar and spell checking software on your computer. Send it off to a trusted friend for a quick second read through. Don’t rush or skip this process or you will appear sloppy and it could impact the final outcome.', '1. Make or save a copy of your letter. As soon as you’ve proofread your draft, and prior to sending it off, take a photo (transfer to pdf), save a draft online, or make a traditional copy of your letter. You may also want to write down the mail off date if it doesn’t match the one at the top of the letter. File this copy somewhere safe for your personal record.', '2. Place it in the standard mail. Take your letter to the local post office, give it to your mail carrier, or drop it in a post box. If you want more assurance that your letter was received you can always request extra tracking services for an additional fee.\nIf you are going to mail off a hard copy of your letter, make sure to print it out using a high quality printer with a good ink cartridge. A handwritten extension request is generally not acceptable.', '3. Email your extension request. This is the probably the best way to send your request as it requires little time and is very reliable. Verify your recipient’s email address before sending and include your identification number, if relevant, in the subject line.\nYour recipient may be able to see the exact time that you sent the email. Be aware of this if you like to send off emails very late at night.\nKeep your email formal and that includes the address that you use as well. Send this email from a professional-sounding account. For example, sending a work email from “John.k.Smith@yahoo.com” is appropriate.\nIf you send your letter via fax, make sure to hold on to the confirmation page showing that your transmission was successfully sent and received.', '4. Make a phone call instead of writing. If your need for an extension is urgent or very last minute, you may be better served by talking to them in person or by calling. If this is the situation, continue to act formally and state your case in an organized way.']"
