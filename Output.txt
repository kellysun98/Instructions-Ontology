Wash your hair before you cut it. Your hair will be easier to work with if it's clean and snarl-free. Get your hair wet under running water and use shampoo and conditioner, rinsing both out after you've worked them through your hair.Detangle your hair with a comb. Run the comb through your hair and work out any knots with the comb or with your fingers. Ridding your hair of tangles beforehand will result in a cleaner, more even cut.
If your hair dries out while you comb it, spritz it with water until it's damp again.
Use a detangling product or a natural remedy to tackle particularly stubborn snarls.Towel dry your hair. The best time to cut your hair is when it's damp, but not soaking wet. If your hair's still dripping, dry it off with a towel. Comb your hair again to get rid of any tangles made from drying it.
If you cut your hair while it's still wet, it may not lay the same way it does while it's dry.Find a comfortable place to cut your hair. Cutting your hair can take up to several hours, especially if you've never done it before. Choose a spot where you can sit down and work without worrying about making a mess.
The best place to cut hair is the bathroom, where you'll have access to running water and a mirror.Position yourself near a mirror. You’ll want to be able to see what you’re doing as much as possible. A large-sized mirror on your bathroom wall or medicine cabinet will help you see what you’re cutting in front or on the sides.
If possible, set up a second mirror so you can see the back of your head, either hanging from the wall opposite or as a hand mirror held by someone else.Section your hair into parts. Run the comb back through your hair right about where your head curves, then comb the hair between the part and the ear down. Do this on both sides to section off both sides of your head.
If your hair is long enough, you can use clips to hold the top section away from your sides.Use clippers on a small guard setting to cut the back and sides. Clippers are the best for the back and sides for beginners or those who want a basic haircut. Set your clippers' guard, which controls how much hair you can cut, to 1 or 2 to make conservative cuts while you work.Cut one side of the head at a time. Use a low clipper guard around sides and, with the blade's edge, trim from the bottom of the sides to the top. Tilt the clipper blade at an angle as you work to create an even fade with the rest of your hair. Then, repeat this process on the other side of your head before moving to the back, making sure to transition between lengths at the same point on both sides.
Going against your hair's grain will result in a cleaner cut.
Some clippers come with ear tapers, which help you cut above and around your ears. Use these, if available, to make cleaner cuts around the ears.Move to the back of your head. After cutting your sides, trim the back of your head from the bottom to the top as you did with the sides. To make sure you're cutting evenly, have a friend hold up a mirror or position a mirror behind you so you can check your progress as you cut.
Use the same guard length on the back and sides of your hair when performing basic, at-home haircuts.Go over the lower half with a shorter setting. To even out fades between cuts, go over the lower half of your hair with your clippers set to a shorter setting. Lift your hair as you approach your temples and earlobes.
Work slowly while using clippers to ensure as even of a fade as possible.Use styling scissors on the top of your head. Using styling scissors instead of clippers will help you make more precise cuts and give your hair more texture. You can buy styling scissors online or at most hair care stores.
Do not use household scissors to cut your hair, as they aren't sharp enough to properly cut hair so you're more likely to make mistakes.Trim the top in sections. Use your fingers or a comb to raise the hair from the top of your head. Work slowly and carefully in 1/4 in (about 6 mm) sections. These should be parallel to the front of your hairline. As you trim, pull a little of the previously cut section into the new section as a traveling guideline.
Cuts to the hair on top of your head are more noticeable than cuts to the hair on the sides of your head. Always start with conservative cuts. Remember, you can always cut more, but you can't add back lost length.
When you've finished with this area, you can check your guideline by holding up a section of hair that is perpendicular to your hairline. Your hair should be the same length across the entirety of this section.
Be gentle on your head while cutting the crown, which is usually more tender than the rest of the head.Trim your bangs, if applicable, with styling scissors. If you have bangs, section it into small parts. Brush your comb through each section the amount you want to cut pokes through the end and trim it off with your scissors.Even out the sides. Use a mirror to check your sides and make sure they are even. Comb your hair straight out and grab a horizontal section from about the same point on each side of your head. Check to see if these sections are the same length. If they are not, trim away any extra length and bumps, taking off small amounts at a time. Remember, it's always easier to cut a little and touch up more later.Cut your sideburns to your desired length. You can trim your sideburns with either a safety razor or with your clippers. If you want long sideburns, trim from the bottom of your ears. If shorter, you can use the depression below your cheekbone to determine where the bottoms of your sideburns should be.
Place your fingers underneath each sideburn to check that they’re even after trimming.Blend your top with your sides. Comb the top of your hair down toward your sides. Holding your sheers vertically, cut into the corners to remove bulk.Taper your neckline. Use your clippers or a beard trimmer to cut the hair growing on the nape of your neck. Start with a grazing cut at the top of the neckline, then cut progressively closer as you work toward the nape of the neck.
Use a handheld mirror to examine your neckline after tapering it to make sure it looks neat and even.Style your hair immediately after cutting it. After cutting your hair, rinse it in the shower to remove any strays. Towel dry, then, part it with a comb and style it as you usually would. Decide whether you're happy with your new style and, if not, either cut it again or visit a hairstylist to make extensive changes.
If you notice any mistakes or uneven areas while styling, trim these areas again as needed.Arrange to wake up after midnight. After praying the Isha prayer and before going to sleep, make arrangements to wake up during the night before the Fajr prayer (for instance, you may want to set an alarm clock or have a family member agree to wake you). Though the Tahajjud can be prayed at any part of the night, if possible, it is best to pray it after midnight, especially during the last third of the night. The time two-thirds of the way between Isha and Fajr is a good time for Tahajjud. This is because Allah descends to the lowest heaven during the last third of the night, asking, "Who is asking me, so I can give to him? Who is calling upon me, so I can answer him? Who is seeking my forgiveness, so I can forgive him?'" 
If you make an honest effort to wake up and perform the Tahajjud but accidentally sleep through the night, don't feel guilty. According to ahadeeth, Allah records your genuine intention to perform the Tahajjud and grants you sleep as an act of mercy. You will be rewarded as if your intention had been fulfilled. However, if you make a conscious decision to abandon your intention to pray Tahajjud without good reason, for example through laziness, then it may not be overlooked. tWake up and perform Wudu. Wake up during the night at the time you've chosen. Once you wake, perform Wudu, the ritual ablution Muslims use to cleanse themselves before they pray or handle the Holy Quran. Traditionally, performing Wudu means using clean water to wash oneself in the following four ways:
Washing the face
Washing the arms and hands up to and including the elbows
Wiping the head (Masah)

Washing the feet up to the ankles
Note that many Muslims (including the Prophet Muhammad [pbuh]) also choose to wash their mouth and teeth with a miswak before the Tahajjud.
If you have discharged mani earlier in the night, whether during sexual intercourse or a wet dream, then the Ghusl full-body ritual cleansing must be performed.Go somewhere clean, quiet, and dignified to conduct your prayer. This is done because Allah's names are pure, so, whenever possible, Muslims are encouraged to speak of Him in clean, holy places as a form of reverence. Wearing your normal prayer clothes, sit down on a prayer mat and face the Holy Kabah in Mecca as you would for your obligatory prayers.
To be clear, you don't need to be anywhere special, like a mosque or a lavishly-decorated room in your house, to pray the Tahajjud. All that's needed is a spot that's clean which can even be in your room.Remove all worldly worries from your heart. At the time for prayer, calmly focus and reflect on the glory of your Lord. Do not worry about fleeting worldly problems that are ultimately meaningless in comparison to His infinite wisdom and mercy. Calm yourself and forget your worldly problems, hopes, and fears. Ignore any negative, distracting thoughts or feelings. Close your eyes and focus your attention on your heart as you begin to achieve a heightened state of spiritual awareness.Make your intention to pray known. As you start your prayer, make a definitive mental declaration to yourself that you are about to perform the Tahajjud. Decide that you are going to complete the Tahajjud in the specific way you have chosen, including how many rakats and which surahs you will recite. Also decide why you are saying the Tahajjud — for instance, to glorify Allah, thank Allah or ask for His forgiveness. You don't have to make this declaration out loud — Allah knows your thoughts, so your intentions will be clear to him as long as they are clear to you.
The Tahajjud is typically performed by repeating multiple rakats (cycles) of Salah, the ritual that Muslims use for their required daily prayer. For the Tahajjud, the rakats are usually performed in pairs, so you'll also want to decide exactly how many rakats you intend to perform at this time. See below for more information.Perform two rakats. To begin your Tahajjud, start by performing two rakats (cycles) of Salah. Salah begins by standing and reciting verses from the Holy Quran. Then, the person praying continues by bowing low with his hands on his knees, then  prostrating on the ground with his forehead, nose, and palms on the floor and his elbows raised, sitting on his knees with his feet folded under him, and finally standing and reciting "Allahu Akbar." This description of Salah is a generalization — if you're not sure how to perform Salah properly, learn this fundamental Muslim skill before attempting the Tahajjud.
Emulate the practices of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) who used to recite the following surahs after each rakat in Tahajjud:After reciting the Al-Fatihah the first rakat, recite the surah "Al-Kafirun".
After reciting the Al-Fatihah for the second rakat, recite the surah "Al-Ikhlas".Repeat rakats as you wish. Generally, two rakats is seen as the minimum necessary for a proper Tahajjud. However, it's possible to repeat as many more as you wish. For instance, according to the Hadiths, the Prophet Muhammad frequently prayed up to thirteen rakats. Tahajjud rakats are performed in pairs and eight rakats is seen as a good number by many Muslims. In other words, most people will say two, four, six, or eight rakats, though more is not discouraged.
If you are able to, then reciting long surahs such as Al-Baqarah, An-Nisā’ or Al-‘Imran are highly commended, even if you can manage them only from time to time.
Following in the example of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), if you notice dawn approaching while you say your Tahajjud, you may end by performing one rakat as Witr (an optional pre-dawn prayer said before the required Fajr).Add your own prayers (dua) after the rakats. After you've completed the number of rakats you set out to pray, you may add your own dua as long as they're sincere, respectful, and done in complete devotion to Allah. These may be offered in extended prostration in your own words and language. You may want to offer additional thanks and praise to Allah, pray for strength and guidance, or make a special request for help. For instance, you may ask for blessings for a friend who is suffering through difficult times or help with your own worship or simply spend a few moments thanking Allah for a blessing that He granted you the previous day. Prayers should be offered with humbleness, fear, hope and patience. This is an ideal time to ask for forgiveness for your mistakes and sins as Allah is especially open to our repentance at night according to many ahadeeth.
Acknowledge each of your wrongdoings, however big or small - you may feel that some are insignificant, but Allah may still decide that a penalty is due. Sincerely promise not to repeat your sins and ask Allah for forgiveness.
Use the fear of displeasing Allah to drive yourself to become a better Muslim.
Never lose hope of Allah's mercy for the Qur'an tells us more than 70 times that Allah is the Most Forgiving.
Any prayer you offer will be heard, and, if Allah wills, your prayer will be answered in kind.Go back to bed, if you become too tired to complete the Tahajjud. Because the Tahajjud interrupts your normal sleep, it's not unlikely that you may be somewhat tired when you attempt the prayer. If, however, you're so tired that you find yourself forgetting what you're saying as you recite your prayers or you doze off in the middle of your Tahajjud, don't attempt to complete the prayer. In this case, according to several ahadeeth, Allah notes your sincere willingness to complete the Tahajjud. You may go back to sleep without any need to be embarrassed or ashamed, but try to better prepare yourself next time, perhaps by going to bed earlier.Read scriptural passages about Prophet Muhammad (pbuh)'s observance of the Tahajjud. To gain a greater understanding of the unique importance of the Tahajjud prayer, you may want to consult any of the numerous references to the prayer in Islamic scripture. Most notably, the Tahajjud is mentioned in the Quran and discussed at great length in numerous ahadeeth. However, it is also discussed in the work of Islamic scholars throughout the history of the religion.
To start, try reading Book 21 (Prayer at Night) from Sahih Bukhari. No less than 70 ahadeeth in this book describe the habits the Prophet (pbuh) regarding the Tahajjud, which gives an indication of its significance in the life of a good Muslim. Commentary on the Tahajjud is also offered at multiple points in the Quran, including Surat 17:79 and Surat 39:9.Consider saying the Tahajjud with your family. Muslim families are encouraged to pray the Tahajjud in communion with each other because both Muhammad (pbuh) and his wife Aisha recommended that husbands and wives should say the Tahajjud together. Performing the Tahajjud as a family allows you to come closer to each other in devotion to Allah and to show solidarity in your worship.
If you're interested in trying this, ask your spouse and/or children to join you before the first night you plan to say the Tahajjud together, then, if they need your help to do so, wake them up and celebrate Allah's infinite greatness and mercy in quiet prayer together. Children over the age of ten should be gently encouraged to develop the habit of praying Tahajjud when they are ready, but if it is too difficult for them to wake in the night then no blame should be apportioned and they should not be admonished, as long as they are up for Fajr and complete all their obligatory prayers correctly.
Encourage your children by reminding them of the rewards that are available for completing voluntary acts of worship like Tahajjud, and warn them of the consequences of not making the sacrifices that Allah expects and deserves.
Generally, families that pray the Tahajjud together make exceptions for members that need their sleep, like small children, the sick, and the elderly.Emulate the practices of Prophet Muhammad (pbuh). All Muslims are encouraged to live in emulation of the life of Muhammad (pbuh), Allah's Messenger and the Seal of the Prophets. If you're looking for guidance in performing the Tahajjud, you may want to study the ways Muhammad (pbuh) performed the Tahajjud and try to work these habits into your daily life. By striving to emulate the Prophet (pbuh)'s Tahajjud practices, Muslims can work towards the perfect ideal represented by him and, in doing so, become closer to Allah.
As noted above, Book 21 from Sahih Bukhari is a great place to start if you're looking for information on Muhammad (pbuh)'s Tahajjud habits and practices.Make the Tahajjud part of your routine. As an optional prayer, the Tahajjud certainly isn't something that any Muslim should feel compelled to do and there is no punishment for missing it. However, many Muslims choose to practice the Tahajjud on a regular basis (if not every night) when they are able. Like all forms of prayer, saying the Tahajjud brings you closer to Allah. In addition, the Tahajjud is often associated with Allah's gifts of forgiveness and redemption, making it a great way to seek correction for each day's minor failures, sins and imperfect actions.
Remember that Allah appreciates regular acts of worship, so if you start praying Tahajjud, try not to give it up. If you're interested in making the Tahajjud a regular part of your life, you may want to try setting a recurring alarm to wake you up during the night or even having a predetermined area in your house for performing this prayer.
If you are unable to commit to praying Tahajjud every single night, then try build up slowly by establishing the habit of saying just two or four rakats two or three times a week, whatever you can manage, with the aim of building up over time.Work outside or in a well-ventilated area. The fumes from bleach are extremely strong and they can be dangerous, so make sure you set up your project in an area with plenty of fresh air. If you can, try to work outside. If that’s not an option, choose a large room and open a window or turn on a fan.Protect your hands with heavy rubber gloves. Bleach is a strong chemical. Even when it’s diluted it can cause chemical burns on your skin. Be sure to wear heavy rubber gloves (like the kind used for cleaning) to protect your skin while you’re tie dyeing your clothes with bleach. You can get these wherever cleaning supplies are sold.Choose cotton clothing in a dark color. Black is the best color for tie dyeing with bleach because you will get the best contrast, but you can use any color as long as it’s dark enough to produce an effect. Experiment with different colors to find what you like!Avoid garments made from delicate or synthetic fabrics. Bleach won’t affect synthetic materials like polyester because they are designed to be colorfast. In addition, bleach can damage more delicate fabrics such as silk.Lay down old towels or a drop cloth. If you’re working inside, you’ll need to protect your work surface from bleach, so cover it with a drop cloth or old towels that can get messed up. If you’re using an absorbent material like a towel, be sure it doesn’t get soaked or the bleach will seep through and ruin whatever’s beneath it.
If you’re working outside, you’ll want to have something laid on the ground to protect your garment from getting dirty during the tie dyeing process.Twist your garment to create a pattern and secure it with rubber bands. Space the rubber bands several inches apart. The parts of your garment that are rubber-banded will stay the original color, while the exposed fabric will turn white when you bleach it.
You can get creative with your designs or you can just bunch up the fabric and put rubber bands on it to get a random and totally unique look.
As closely tied as the rubber band or the string you use will be, the tenser removing it will become. If you want, instead or removing, you can cut off the rubber bands carefully, in the end.Twirl the garment to create a spiral pattern. To create a traditional spiral tie-dye pattern, hold your garment with 2 fingers and twirl it so it twists tightly. Keep twirling until the entire garment is twisted into a tight knot. Secure the twirl with several rubber bands, then apply your bleach mixture. You can use a string to tie it up too. The tighter the spirals are secured, the better the distinction between darker and lighter areas will be formed.Create several patterns on the same garment with knots. If you want to create a haphazard tie-dye, try using rubber bands to create several tight, small knots on the garment. Bunch these all together and secure with more rubber bands, then apply the bleach. Secure them tightly so the bleach doesn't seep through the knots.Relocate the rubber bands and re-spray for a multi-hue effect. If you want to create a layered look, twist up your garment and apply rubber bands, then apply bleach to your fabric and let it sit for about 5-6 minutes. Take all of the rubber bands off your garment, twist your garment again, put the rubber bands back on, and re-spray the garment with the bleach mixture. Leave the second batch on for the 8-10 minutes, then rinse.Create an ombre effect on your garment by dipping it in a bleach mixture. After you’ve tie-dyed your garment, you can make a cool faded effect by dip-dyeing the fabric. In a large bucket, dilute another mixture of 1/2 bleach and 1/2 water. Dip the bottom few inches of your garment in the bucket and leave it for 5-10 minutes to create an ombre effect.Fill a spray or squeeze bottle with a mixture of 1/2 bleach and 1/2 water. You can get a bottle for your project at almost any store which sells cleaning supplies. You can use either a spray bottle or a squeeze bottle. A squeeze bottle may produce a slightly more precise effect than a spray bottle, but the results will be similar with either one.Apply the bleach mixture to the exposed fabric of the garment. Spray or squeeze the bleach mixture from your bottle onto your garment. You can vary the amount of bleach that you use depending on how intense you want the color change to be. A heavier application of bleach will cause the fabric to lighten more, and you can create different looks by applying the bleach only to some areas and not to others.Allow the bleach to sit on the fabric for 8-10 minutes. You should be able to see the bleach changing the color of the garment within about 2 minutes, but it will take 8-10 minutes for the bleach to really seep into the fabric. If you leave it on much longer the bleach could damage your garment.Wash the garment in a mild detergent when the time is up. Remove all the rubber bands. You want to wash your garment right away to stop the chemical bleaching process. You can either put your clothing in the washing machine with a mild detergent or you can hand wash it in your sink or bathtub.
If you hand wash your garment, make sure to leave on your gloves until you’ve finished rinsing it so you don’t come into contact with any bleach.
Have your bathtub rinsed well if you washed in it.Hang your garment to air-dry or place it in the dryer. Once your garment is thoroughly rinsed, you can either air-dry it or put it in the dryer, depending on how you normally prefer to dry your clothes. After it’s dry, it’s ready to wear, so put it on and enjoy your new style!Keep the toilet from overflowing. If your toilet doesn't flush properly after one flush, don't flush again. This will cause more water to be pumped into the toilet bowl. Instead, take the lid off of the toilet tank and close the toilet flapper. Closing the flapper will keep more water from entering the bowl.
The flapper looks like a circular drain stopper attached to a chain.
The water in the tank isn't dirty, so it's fine to stick your hand inside to close the flapper.Prepare the bathroom. In case splashing occurs, place newspapers or paper towels on the floor to soak up liquid. The paper will make for easier cleanup later. You should also turn on the ventilation fan or open a window to rid the area of foul odors.
If the clog is serious, put on a pair of rubber gloves. Toilets are unsanitary, but a good pair of rubber cleaning gloves will protect you from any germs within. Choose gloves that reach up to your elbows.
You may also want to put on an old set of clothing, just in case things get messy.See if you can clear the obstruction. If you can see the cause of the clog, reach in and remove it from the toilet if possible. If you can't clear it with your hands, but you know there's an object (such as a child's toy) causing the clog, skip the plunging and go straight to another method.Use a high quality plunger. It is important to use a large heavy-duty rubber plunger, either the ball-shaped type or one with a fold-out rubber flange on the bottom which forms a seal. Do not use the small cheap suction-cup type of plunger. These will often not work.
Run the plunger under hot water before using it. This will soften it up, which will help with create a seal.Insert the plunger into the bowl. Make sure the plunger completely covers the hole. The plunger should be submerged in water to be effective. It is important to be pushing and pulling water through the opening, not air. Add water from the sink to the bowl if necessary.
Pump the plunger over the hole. Start slowly at first, since the first plunge will push air into the bowl. Push down, then pull up sharply to disturb the clog and loosen it. Continue vigorously pushing and pulling until the water begins to drain. It may take 15 to 20 cycles before the toilet unclogs. Be patient. As long as you're sure there's no hard object, plunging alone often suffices. It might not work immediately but will often work after a few repeated efforts and flushings, with each effort consisting of dozens of plunge cycles.Flush the toilet to check the drainage. If the plunging eventually drains the bowl, but the clog is still blocking a free flow down the drain, leave the plunger in the bowl and fill the bowl with water again. Fill it to the point it is normally after a regular flush, then plunge again. Stubborn clogs might require you to do this a number of times.Purchase an enzyme waste removal product. Look for a product that contains a mixture of enzymes that liquify waste materials. These enzymes are used in septic systems to break down waste.
Products of this sort can be usually be purchased at home improvement stores in or near the plumbing aisle. Enzyme waste removal is preferable to using a drain-clearing chemical because it will not harm your pipes or the environment.
This method will only work on organic waste, not toys or other objects.Follow the instructions on the container. Pour the recommended amount of the enzyme product into the toilet bowl. You will typically be instructed to wait overnight for the enzymes to go to work on the clog. The toilet should drain once the clog has cleared.Heat half a gallon of water. If the toilet tends to clog easily as the result of trying to flush too much waste, using a combination of hot water, baking soda and vinegar will often do the job as well as a commercial drain cleaner. Boil half a gallon of water, then let it cool for a moment while you add other ingredients to the toilet bowl.
Use at least half a gallon. A small amount of water won't work, since it won't have enough force to push through the clog.
The water should be no hotter than a hot tea you can drink comfortably. It should not be boiling, since very hot water can crack porcelain. You want to raise the temperature of the water passing around or pressing on the clog.Pour 1 cup baking soda and 2 cups vinegar into the toilet. The baking soda and vinegar create a chemical process that help to dissolve clogs. Distilled white vinegar is commonly used, but any type of vinegar will work. The mixture will fizz a great deal. 
If you don't have baking soda and vinegar on hand, try adding a few squirts of dish soap to the toilet bowl. The soap may help to loosen the clog. 
This method isn't likely to work for clogs caused by a hard obstruction, such as a toy.Pour the hot water into the bowl. Pour it from waist level, rather than right near the rim. The force of the water falling into the bowl can help to clear the clog.Let the mixture stand overnight. In the morning, the water should have drained.  This homemade drain cleaner should successfully clear clogs caused by organic material. If the water won't flush on your second try, you may have hard obstruction causing the clog. Try using a wire coat hanger or a drain snake.Purchase or borrow a plumbing snake. A plumbing snake (also sometimes called a "flexible cleaning tool" or "auger") is a flexible coil of wire that can "snake" through the curves of a drain and get deeper than a wire can. The best snake is a "closet auger" which is designed specifically to clear toilet clogs without damaging or staining the bowl. A plumber would likely use a closet auger.Insert one end of the snake into the drain. Push down, feeding the snake further into the drain until you feel an obstruction.Twist and push the snake through the obstruction. The goal is to break up the obstruction into smaller pieces that can move through the pipes. It may take a few minutes of maneuvering to clear the obstruction. Once the water drains, flush the toilet to see whether it drains as quickly as normal.Snake in reverse. It may become necessary to remove the toilet and run the snake through in the opposite direction. This is especially true with hard obstructions that may have been flushed by a curious child. If the obstruction is known to be hard and you are not comfortable removing and replacing the toilet, contact a plumber.Unravel and straighten a wire coat hanger. Then wrap the end of the wire with a rag. Use duct tape to keep the rag in place. This will prevent the sharp end from damaging the porcelain in your toilet. The wire hanger method will generally work only if there is an obstruction in the first few inches of the drain.Stick the wrapped end of the wire into the drain. Once the wire is in the drain, twist it, push it, and maneuver it in a circular motion to clear the drain. If you can feel the obstruction, push against it. Keep going until the water begins to drain.
Make sure you're wearing rubber gloves as you do this. You may get splashed as you move the wire around.
If you can't feel an obstruction, and the toilet won't drain, the clog must be out of reach of the hanger. Try the plumbing snake method to clear it.Flush the toilet once the water has drained. The obstruction and dirty water should now be able to flow through the drain like normal. If the toilet is still slow to drain, the obstruction may have gotten pushed further back, out of reach of the hanger. In this case you'll need to use a plumbing snake to clear it.Purchase a chemical drain cleaner. They're available at most grocery, hardware, and "big box" stores. Use this method only as a last resort. The chemicals used in drain cleaners are toxic to people and pets, corrosive to pipes. Also, chlorinated drain cleaner are very damaging to the environment.
If you suspect that there is a hard obstruction, do not use a chemical solution. Instead, use a snake or call a plumber.
Only use chemicals that are specifically made for toilets. Using other drain cleaners may damage your toilet.Pour the specified amount into the toilet. Be sure you follow the manufacturer's instructions. Keep the lid down to prevent toxic fumes from filling your bathroom.
Never use a plunger right after adding the drain-cleaning chemicals. The chemicals could possibly shoot back up onto your skin.
Make sure the bathroom is well ventilated so you won't inhale the chemicals.Buy or borrow a wet/dry vacuum. If you have tried plunging and snaking to no avail, consider using a wet/dry vacuum. Do not use an ordinary vacuum cleaner––it must be the wet/dry variety that can cope with water.Empty the water out of the bowl using the vacuum. The bowl must be free of water and any other debris in order to vacuum out the obstruction.Place the end of the vacuum hose into the drain. Push it into the toilet bowl a few inches into the hole. Use just the flexible hose, rather than an attachment. Coil an old towel around the hole to create a seal around the drain.Turn on the vacuum. Use one hand to put pressure on the towels to create a good seal. Wait a moment or two for the vacuum to work. There's a good chance the vacuum can suck out the clog.Get the hair damp. Before you start cutting hair, spray it down so that you can easily mold and cut the hair. The hair should be lightly damp but not soaking wet. Take a towel and pat down the hair again to dry it slightly. Then grab a comb and part the hair. 

Knowing where the hair will be parted is important because you may have to blend the shorter side a little more than the longer side depending on the style.Choose the right guard size for the fade line. A lower guard size means a shorter cut. Pick a higher guard number to start with like a #3.
You can use a higher number to get an even shave around the sides and back of the head as a baseline.
To get the fade look you will switch to shorter guards as you move down. But by starting with the larger guard size you can easily get an even fade.
You will shave the entire sides and back of the hair with your first guard and then repeat with a lower guard, moving part way down the head, leaving the top the length you just cut.	EXPERT TIP																															Laura Martin																Licensed Cosmetologist								Laura Martin is a Licensed Cosmetologist in Georgia. She has been a hair stylist since 2007 and a cosmetology teacher since 2013.										Laura Martin			Licensed Cosmetologist				Laura Martin, a licensed cosmetologist, notes: "To create a fade you gradually transition from using no guard along the hairline to a higher guard (a 1 or 2) as you move up the sides of the head. The top can be short and blended or long and disconnected."Decide where you want the fade line(s). The fade line will determine where the hair transitions from one length to another. It will wrap all the way around the back of the head, essentially going from ear to ear.
Fade lines don't have to go straight across in the back. In fact, some fade lines dip slightly around the back of the head, then return to the original line before reaching the other ear.
You can have more than one fade line. Start with one on your first cut; as you get more confident, try doing two.
Where you position the fade line is a matter of personal taste. You can put it anywhere from slightly above the top of the ear to 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) above that.Section off the top portion of hair. Take a comb, and trace a rectangle above the round of the skull. This will separate the longer top hair from the shorter sides. Use a clip or an elastic band to keep this hair out of the way. 
If you are uncertain how big the rectangle should be, use the eyebrows as a guide. The lines of the rectangle should line up with the outer tips of the eyebrows. Include the entire crown at the back of the head.Move the clippers vertically as you begin to shave the hair. Just like shaving your face, the general rule of thumb is to shave in the opposite direction that the hair grows. Start at the sideburns and move the clippers in an upward motion as you back towards the head.
Do not cut the sectioned-off hair on top of the head.
Move your clippers in an upward motion, moving out with an arc with each movement.
With your free hand, lightly press down on the scalp just below where you are currently cutting. This will ensure a smooth, even cut.Move the clippers sideways across the fade line. This doesn’t mean turning the clippers horizontally though, keep them vertical. Remember that the fade line is where the hair transitions from one length to the next.
Hold the clippers in your hand so that your thumb is over the top, with your other fingers beneath. Move your wrist in a "flicking" motion upward.
To make the fade lines disappear and give the hair a consistent transition, you want to angle the clippers so that only the bottom third or quarter of the blade is actually touching the head at the fade line.
The portion of the blade, the teeth, that isn't touching the head will still cut the hair, but at a "natural" fade angle.Keep a steady hand and move in small sections. The slower you go and the more precise you are, the better the cut will look, and you won’t spend a lot of time in the end cleaning up uneven spots.
Push the clippers forward a bit on uneven spots to make sure the blades are catching the hair.
To cut behind the ears, pull the top of the ear down and cut straight up starting at the spot where the ear connects to the head. You may have to cut at an angle to get the hair behind the ear.Switch guards to continue fading the hair. Once you’ve got the base cut around the sides and back of the head, it’s time to switch to your next guard. If you Started with a #3, switch to a #2.
Repeat the same shaving technique as before, starting at the bottom and moving up.
Don’t go all the way to the top. To get an even fade you’ll want to pick a spot where your next fade line will be. This will vary from person to person, but your second fade line should be above the ear.
Depending on how much of a fade you want, you may have to switch guards again and repeat the process, shaving the lower portion of the head with a #1.Clean up the fade line with the clippers-over-comb method. Start to clean up the fade by grabbing a regular comb. (Use a white comb for dark hair, and a dark comb for light hair.)  Angle the comb so that it's at a 45-degree angle to the fade line and comb upward toward the top of the head, only moving the comb an inch or two into the hair. Run the clippers upward over the comb, from the fade line, so that they cut the hair that's above the teeth.
Repeat this process around the fade line(s), taking care to keep your combing distance the same all the way around.
If done correctly, you should have a nice even fade with no visible fade lines. The hair should gradually get shorter as it gets closer to the base of the skull.Cut the top of the hair. Either use scissors if you want to keep the hair long, or a higher guard if you want a buzzed look. For something like a quiff, pompadour, or messy top, you’ll use scissors; while a caesar, or crew might need clippers.

To cut with scissors, use a comb or your fingers and pull the hair up, cutting above the fingers or comb a little at a time.The fingers or comb should be kept straight and parallel to the floor as you cut.
Take into account the angle at which you are cutting. For a fade look with longer hair on top, you will want to cut the hair at an angle as you move towards the back of the head to blend it.
Check the corners as you cut. To do this, pull out a lock from the top of the hair and check the edges. The corners of this cut should be soft.
If too much hair is falling back from the top, you can use a thinning shear or clippers to trim it back.Shave the bottom of the hair with a beard trimmer or unguarded clippers. Now you want to make sure that fade has a distinct ending point at the base of the head and bottoms of the sideburns. Take your trimmer or clippers and shave any remaining hair away.
You may not need to do this to the sideburns if the person whose hair you are cutting has facial hair connecting to the sideburns.
Shave down the base of the neck and up a little way on the lowest fade to make sure that the hair is evened out.Blur out any remnants of the visible line using your clippers. Look for any patches where the hair is uneven now and make sure to go over them again to clean them up.
You may have to position your clippers at a bit of an angle to get any stragglers and even out the fade.Clean up the base of the neck. Now that your bottom fade line is established, cut the hair beneath it. Make sure you get the sections at the bottom of the neck that have thinner longer hairs.
Clean up the edges using a straight razor or the trimmer to make sure the edges of the cut are clean, as well as removing any neck hair.
If you are using a straight razor, apply shaving cream to the area you are about to cut, then pad with a warm damp towel.
Brush off any loose hairs and style the top with a pomade or gel for a finished look.Get a set of professional-grade clippers. Clippers can get expensive, but in order to ensure that you get a consistent fade, you’ll need clippers that are powerful and reliable. A great pair of clippers will make all the difference.
Some popular and highly rated clippers are:
Oster Classic 76 Clipper w/ 2 Blades.
Wahl Senior clippers.
Andis Master clippers.

Make sure the clippers come with at least 5 different guard sizes.
It's also a good idea to purchase a professional trimmer, which is used to line sideburns and clean up the areas around the ears, neck and forehead.  Ask your barber where he purchases his, or look around online.Clean your clipper blades. Even if you have new clippers, you should make sure that they are clean before oiling them. Your clipper set should come with a cleaning solution, but if you don’t have a cleaning solution you can use distilled white vinegar.
Make sure your clippers are unplugged and remove the blades.
If you have a solution, spray the solution over your blades and let it sit before wiping off.
If you are using distilled white vinegar put the blades to soak for a few minutes in a solution of vinegar.
Avoid washing your clippers with soap and water as this can cause your blades to rust.Oil the blades before use. Read the instructions that come with your clippers to see if you need to remove the blades for oiling, or if you can simply point them toward the bottom of a sink and drop oil onto them. After you've applied oil to the blades, wipe off any excess with a soft, dry cloth.
When oiling your clippers, you should make sure that you’ve brushed off any excess hair that might be in the blades.
Turn your clippers on and drip the oil onto the blades, allowing the moving blades to become saturated.
Run the blades for about 20 seconds.
Thoroughly wipe the blades down, making sure that the tops of your blades are dry so hair doesn’t stick.Place a medium-sized pot on the stove. Even though this recipe makes a fairly small batch of sugar wax (approximately enough for 2 legs), use a medium or large pot to make it. The mixture starts to bubble when you heat it, and it can overflow if you use a small pot.Add the white sugar, lemon juice, and warm water to the pot. Measure out the granulated white sugar and dump it into the pot. Then add the lemon juice and warm water. Stir to combine them.
Use white or brown granulated sugar. Powdered sugar won't work at all.Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. Turn your burner on high and let the mixture heat up until it starts to boil. Stir frequently. Keep an eye on the mixture, since it will start to bubble as it heats up.
Take care not to burn the mixture. If you do, it will completely solidify once it cools down, making it unusable.Reduce the heat to medium. Once the mixture starts bubbling and boiling, turn the heat down to medium. Continue to stir frequently. The sugar should be completely dissolved in the liquid at this point.
If the mixture continues to bubble rapidly at medium heat, turn it down to low.Remove the pot from heat when the mixture turns golden brown. Keep stirring the mixture as it simmers. Once it reaches a smooth consistency and becomes a deep golden color, turn off the heat and move the pot to another burner.
The consistency should be similar to hot syrup. If it's thick like honey, heat it a little longer.Pour the mixture into a bowl or jar and let it cool for 30 minutes. Unlike traditional hot wax, sugar wax should not be used hot. Pour it in a bowl or jar and give it about 30 minutes to cool down. If it still feels hot or warm enough to be uncomfortable, let it cool for several more minutes before proceeding.Scoop up a small amount of wax with your fingers. The wax should still be warm but cool enough to touch, so you can use your fingers for the entire process. Scoop up a small amount and roll the wax into a ball with your hands.
You can use a butter knife or a wooden popsicle stick instead of your hands, if you prefer.Apply the wax to a small strip of skin. You can apply it with your fingers or a popsicle stick. Be sure to apply the wax in the opposite direction of hair growth. Spread it evenly until it's about 1/4 in (0.6 cm) thick. Work in small sections that are only a few inches in length and width.
Yields enough wax for both legs (approximately)Take a deep breath and pull! Get a firm grip on the wax with your fingers and pull it off in the opposite direction of your hair growth. Make it quick, just like you are pulling off a bandage. It may hurt a little bit!
You can also use your fingers to roll or pull it off, but this prolongs the pain. It's better to make it quick.
If desired, apply paper strips on top of the wax, smooth them out, and pull those off instead of the mixture itself.

Sugar waxing is the best way to remove hair if you have sensitive skin. Sugar wax is different from regular wax in that it doesn't damage the hair follicle or your skin because it's a very gentle exfoliator.Continue to apply the wax in small sections until you're done. You can reuse the same piece of wax 3 to 4 times, if you like. Or you can use a fresh amount of wax for each section of skin.Pour any leftover wax in an airtight container and refrigerate it. If you have leftover wax, pour it into an airtight container, like a sturdy plastic Tupperware container. Pop it in the fridge and use it within 4 to 5 weeks. Reheat it before you use it.Chop the onion about 1 in (2.5 cm) from the bottom. Place your onion on a cutting board and, using a sharp knife, cut off the bottom and remove the outer peel. Your onion piece should be about 1 in (2.5 cm) long to grow a healthy onion.
If you're growing the onions outside, start your cuttings in early spring. For onions grown indoors, any time of the year is fine.
You can use most onion varieties, including grocery store-bought onions, for growing more onions. This technique works best if you work with a fresh onion that has not yet gone bad.Leave the onion bottom out to dry for 12-24 hours. After chopping the onion, discard the rest of the onion and place the bottom on a flat, dry surface with the cut side up. Let the onion bottom dry out for up to a day until it is calloused and dry to the touch.
If not discarding, you can use the rest of the onion for cooking or for compost if you prefer.Poke toothpicks into each side of the onion. Divide your onion bottom into 4 sides, and poke a toothpick halfway into each side. The toothpicks should be equally spaced apart so they resemble an "X" in spacing.
This will allow you to suspend your onion over water while it roots.Hang the onion over a small bowl of water. Fill a bowl with water to the brim and place it on a flat surface. Position the onion so the bottom just touches the top of the water, and leave it to grow for 3-4 days. Plant the cutting when it begins growing small, white roots from the bottom.
The bowl's diameter should be less wide than the length of the toothpicks.
To help the cutting grow faster, suspend the onion near a sunny window or place it outdoors.Fill a pot with well-draining soil. Purchase a well-draining soil mix and a large pot with holes in the bottom from a plant nursery. Fill the pot with the soil to about halfway full—you will fill it the rest of the way when you plant the onion cutting.
You can also plant your onion bottom outside if your garden has well-draining soil.
You can test to see if soil is well-draining by digging a 12 in (30 cm) hole in the soil and filling it with water. If the water drains in 5-15 minutes, the soil is well-draining.Place the onion cutting in the soil and fill the pot with soil. When the onion cutting grows white roots from the bottom, position it in the center of the soil. Fill the rest of the pot with soil over the onion until 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) from the top of the pot.
Depending on your preference, you can keep the onion cutting indoors or outdoors in sunny weather.
If you plant the whole cut bottom as one piece, you may get more than one new onion but they will likely be crowded together and small.  The number of plants a single onion can grow will vary from 1-6, the onion pictured above can be divided into two.  To get multiple full size new onions from a single onion bottom, use a sharp knife to divide the onion bottom, leaving a portion of the roots on each section, as well as the leaves if it has started sprouting.Water the onion cutting immediately after planting it. Watering the onion cutting helps it adapt to its new environment and grow roots faster. Give your onion enough water that the soil is damp to the touch, but not soaking wet.Spray nitrogen fertilizer into the soil after watering it. Onions thrive in soil with a high nitrogen content. Spray nitrogen fertilizer directly into the soil and mix it with your hands to give your onion the nutrients it needs to grow.
You can buy nitrogen fertilizer from most garden stores or nurseries.
Check the label to determine how much fertilizer to spray into the soil.Give your onion about 1 in (2.5 cm) of water per week. Onions need plenty of water to stay healthy and grow more onions. Check the soil every day—if it feels dry to the touch, water your onion until it feels moist.Weed your garden regularly, if outside. Onions have a hard time competing with invasive plants, and weeds can steal their water and nutrients. Check your garden often for weeds and, if you notice any, pull them right away.
Avoid spraying weed killers around the onion, as most herbicides can kill both weeds and garden plants.
Check for small insects or other pests on your onion as well and, if you see any, spray the onion with a non-toxic, plant-friendly insect repellent.Fertilize your onion every 2 weeks. Fertilizing your onion plant regularly helps it grow large, healthy bulbs. Spray the onion plant at least twice a month with a nitrogen-rich fertilizer until the onion plant's bulb starts to poke from the soil.
When the bulb starts poking out of the soil, stop fertilizing the onion until you harvest it.Harvest your onion when it forms flowers. When your onion starts to grow flowers, it's ready to harvest. Loosen the soil around the onion with your shovel and pull the onion by the base of its green foliage to pull it out of the ground.
On average, it takes onions grown from cuttings about 90-120 days to grow a new bulb.

Steve Masley			Organic Vegetable Gardener				Wondering if it's okay to take off the green onion shoots? Pat Browne and Steve Masley of Grow it Organically say: "You can harvest the shoots from onions whenever you want, but if you want larger bulbs, leave them in place. Each leaf feeds a layer of the onion, so if you have 8 or 10 leaves, you'll have 8 or 10 growing layers on the onion."Keep your lips soft. A soft, smooth, and slightly moist mouth is ideal for kissing. Before you move in, you should make sure your lips aren't chapped or dry so your partner isn't distracted or put off by the state of your lips. If you want to soften your lips before you go in for the kiss, you should try these quick fixes:
Use chapstick. Swipe some over your lips and press them together. (If you're a girl and you have flavored chapstick, all the better!) The only caveat is that you should apply lip balm or gloss an hour or more before you kiss, so your kissing partner feels your soft lips, not the thick layer of gloss over them.
Drink water. Dry lips are a sign of dehydration, so throw back a tall glass of water (or two). You should notice your lips starting to smooth out within 20 to 30 minutes.
Lick your lips. If you're really in a pinch and have no time to spare, quickly run your tongue over your lips and press them together. This should moisten them slightly without making them slobbery or slick. You can even lick your lips a bit subtly while making eye contact with your kissing partner.Freshen your breath. You never want to have bad breath when you are about to kiss someone, whether the kiss is a French kiss or not. Because your mouth will be open in a French kiss, fresh breath is especially important. Practice good dental hygiene. If you know you are about to kiss someone, take a second to brush your teeth or at least rinse out your mouth with water.
Always have breath mints or mint-flavored gum with you if you think there is a chance you might kiss someone while you are out. If you want to be subtle, you can quickly suck on a breath mint or chew gum for a minute in the bathroom, so you don't make it too obvious that you're ready to kiss.
Avoid foods that leave an unpleasant aftertaste or residue, particularly garlic, coffee, onions, milk, and corn. If you're on a dinner date before the big kiss, try to eat strategically.Find the right moment. A good kiss—especially a first kiss or first French kiss—is the culmination of building tension and growing intimacy. Choose your moment right to make sure you and your partner are both in a mindset to really lose yourselves in the kiss. You should have privacy and should both be feeling romantic instead of stressed or distracted, for one thing. When is the moment right? It depends on your individual situation, but here are a few signs to keep in mind:
You have complete privacy. Whether you're alone on your balcony or sitting on a secluded bench in a park, you're not worried that someone will interrupt you.
The other person keeps dropping hints, like locking eyes and looking at your lips, or standing or sitting progressively closer to you. Regardless of your partner's gender, their body language should give you a clue about whether now is the right time to make your move.
You're ending a date that went really well. In the car or on the porch are both good semi-private locations for a goodnight kiss.
It just seems right. If you feel overwhelmingly compelled to kiss someone, don't be too afraid to just go for it. (Just be prepared for an awkward or even troubling situation if you discover your intended didn't feel the same way.)
Ask. If you aren't sure whether the other person is feeling it, bring up the topic. Better to get permission semi-awkwardly and go ahead with confidence than risk missing out on your chance to kiss that special someone (accidentally kiss someone who isn't interested).Make eye contact. Gaze deeply into the other person's eyes. If you want to make your intentions extra clear, slowly move your gaze to their lips, then back up to the eyes. You can even make intense eye contact, break it for a few seconds, and then look back at the person. This is a way of showing the person you want to kiss that you're pleasantly overwhelmed at the sight of them.
Girls can even look at a guy, look down, and then look up through their lashes to be extra flirtatious.Smile. If you're really excited about the prospect of kissing the other person, show it! A smile keeps the situation light and fun, while helping them feel safe and relaxed. Make sure your smile is soft and genuine, however, and not a forced, too-wide, or overly intense smile. Just slowly and languidly ease your lips into a smile. Show your future kissing partner how happy you are to be in their company. Continue to make eye contact as you do this, or break it for a few seconds before you return it.
You can opt for a close-lipped smile instead of smiling while showing your teeth, which might come off more as friendly than alluring or romantic.Break the touch barrier. Once you're alone with the person you like and you're smiling and making eye contact, you can decide if you want to go in for the kiss without touching, or if you want to break the touch barrier first. This can mean sitting with your legs touching, holding hands, putting your hand on the person's knee, stroking the person's arm, or just giving a sign of affection. If you've kissed the person on the lips before, then breaking the touch barrier may feel more natural for you, and you should make an effort to touch the person before you touch lips so both of you feel more at ease.
You can also break the touch barrier as you're moving in to kiss the person. If you're standing, you can touch the person's arms, neck, or shoulders as you move in for the kiss. If you're sitting, you can put a hand on the person's back.Move in. When the moment seems right, go in for the approach. In general, you should be moving slowly enough that the other person has time to say no, but not so slow that the moment loses its spark. When you start to get the feeling that your kissing partner is ready for the next step, you shouldn't dilly-dally. Move your body toward their body until your heads are just a few inches apart. That's when you'll have to start angling your head for the best kissing position.
Take it slow. The slow approach builds tension and anticipation. Move in at a pace that gives the other person a chance to consent (or not). When they see you coming in, they may move to meet you, so going slow will prevent you from accidentally bumping heads.Tilt your head slightly to one side. Meeting head-on will result in bumping noses. Instead, just tilt your head slightly to the left or right. If you notice the other person going in one direction, pick the opposite. Don't put too much pressure on yourself to do this perfectly. If you and your partner end up kissing each other head-on and bumping noses a bit, then you'll naturally adjust your heads into a more comfortable position, where your noses aren't in the way.
Unlike what you may think from the movies, this doesn't have to happen in slow motion. You'll tilt your head as you move closer to the person, not at a snail's pace, so you don't have to worry about having the time to get it perfect.Close your eyes. Just before you make contact, close your eyes. Kissing with your eyes open is generally associated with dishonesty and insincerity, and keeping your eyes closed will help you focus on and enjoy what's happening on your lips. Also, while you may be tempted to open your eyes to see what your kissing partner looks like in the throes of passion, this could actually unexpectedly make you crack up or not feel in the mood to kiss anymore. Closing your eyes can also help you focus on your mouth and to live in the moment, instead of trying to observe everything that's happening at close range.
You can slowly open your eyes later, when you pull apart after the kiss.Keep your mouth in a kissable position. Don't present a stiff pucker, like you would if you went in to kiss your grandma — not only does it communicate non-romantic feelings, but it makes it physically difficult for your partner to initiate a French kiss. On the other hand, keeping your mouth completely loose and still also says that you're not interested. Here's how to hit a happy medium:
Pucker just a little. Push your lips forward slightly, so that you feel the slightest hint of muscle tension around them.
Open your mouth slightly. Instead of aggressively going in for a fully open-mouthed kiss at first, keep your lips just barely parted enough that a tongue could slip between them.Lightly brush your lips over the other person's. Use feather-light pressure at first, so that your lips are just barely grazing over your partner's. This builds more anticipation and excitement than diving straight into a full-on French kiss. This also signals to your partner that you may be wanting more without being too forward about it.
Keep your movements slow. A lot of quick, light kisses don't have the same level of sexiness as a barely-restrained build in tension. Act like you have all the time in the world—the kiss will speed up soon enough.Test the waters. Once you've built a solid foundation for a French kiss with some tongueless kissing, you can give the other person some subtle hints that you're ready to kick it up a notch. In general, if it's your first time kissing the person, you should be a bit cautious before initiating a French kiss, because this may come off as too much too soon. But beyond that, here are some things to keep in mind as you test the waters to signal that you're ready to kiss with your tongue:
Open your mouth more widely. Offering unrestricted access invites the other person to make the first tentative tongue contact.
Lock lips, so that the other person's lower lip is between your two lips. Then, lightly sweep the tip of your tongue over the lower lip. Do one smooth, swift motion so that the contact lasts for less than a second. If they are interested, they'll reciprocate.
Know when to pull back. If you've tried both of the above techniques and your partner hasn't responded, simply leave it alone until next time and focus on regular kissing. Avoid making a big deal of it, or guilting them.Explore with your tongue. If the other person seems interested, go ahead and start French kissing for real. Remember to keep your tongue in motion and your touches light. First, just slowly slide your tongue into your partner's mouth. You can either begin by placing it above or below your partner's tongue, or even move it around the tongue a bit if you're feeling bold. Just make sure your partner's tongue is reciprocating your actions so you're not just kissing a limp tongue, or the romance will dissipate pretty quick. Here are some things to keep in mind as you explore the French kiss:
Stay playful. "Tag" the other person's tongue lightly and retreat back, inviting them to make the next move.
Tongues are loaded with nerve endings, and the mere act of touching your partner's tongue with your own will be very pleasant.
Don't go too deep — jamming your tongue down the other person's throat is a big turn-off. Stay shallow and light at first. See how far your partner wants to go, and follow suit.Breathe. If you’re kissing for an extended period, it’s easy to forget to breathe. Believe it or not, gasping and turning blue isn't very romantic. You may think that a truly passionate kiss involves many minutes of non-stop kisses, but if you really want to up the romance factor, then you have to stay alert and conscious. Once you fall into a rhythm, you should be able to find a suitable pattern for breathing without interrupting the flow of your kisses. Here's what you need to know:
Take small breaths through your nose as you kiss.
Don't be afraid to take a break. If you do it right, it can still be an intimate and sexy moment. Pull back slightly so that your foreheads are still touching, make eye contact, and smile.
As you and your partner grow comfortable with the kiss, you can try breathing through your mouth a little: sharing breaths as well can be romantic (but not everybody likes it).Mix it up. Kisses are like snowflakes: no two are exactly the same. Once you feel comfortable French kissing someone, it is tempting to try to do the same thing every time, but you should resist if you want to keep things interesting. You should be able to fall into a nice, comfortable rhythm while adding enough variety from time to time to keep things interesting. Here's what you can vary:
Speed: Varying the speed of your kisses is a good way to try something different without potentially intimidating your partner. Once you've got the slow kiss mastered, try going a little faster for a few seconds — it should leave you both a little breathless!
Depth: Once you're comfortable with someone, try kissing a little more deeply.  The key to pulling this off is keeping your speed under control. Or, if you want things to be a little more flirty and playful, return to shallow kisses.
Pressure: Like a deep kiss, a hard kiss should be reserved for a situation in which you already know both you and your partner are comfortable. Be a little bit more forceful with your tongue, but be sure to keep it in motion.
Teeth: You may want to try rubbing the backs or front of the other person's teeth with your tongue. This can create a ticklish feeling that might enhance your kiss. You could also try lightly catching the other person's lower lip with your teeth. Be aware, though, that not everyone likes their kisses with a side of teeth — be prepared to put your chompers away.Use your hands. While you should keep your hands polite, especially on a first kiss, you don’t necessarily want them just dangling at your sides. Using your hands and touching your partner's body (while keeping it respectful) can enhance the romantic feeling of the kiss and can make you and your kissing partner feel more connected. Once you make contact with your partner's body, you can move your hands around gently from time to time without being frantic about it. Here's what you need to know about using your hands while you French kiss:
As a general rule, start with your hands on your partner's hips and then slowly move them around their back or up to the face and hair.
Another turn-on for the first kiss is to gently caress the other person's shoulder. It shows you are comfortable with them.
Cradle your partner's face with your hands on their cheeks and their neck.
Or, go for an old standby: simply wrap your arms around your partner in an embrace.Read your partner's body language. Everybody kisses a little differently, and each person enjoys different things in a kiss — there is no "right" way to kiss. Good kissing requires give-and-take, so read your partner’s body language and pay attention to clues that tell you you’re doing something they like. The most important thing is to make sure that your kissing partner is comfortable with the pace of your kissing and affectionate gestures.
Not everybody likes to be kissed the same way, so while your former partner might have enjoyed one method of kissing, your new love might not. You need to learn to read signals and adapt to a style that's comfortable for each of you.
If your partner pulls away or seems uncomfortable at any time, understand that you have to slow it down.
Let your partner kiss you back and move with them as long as you’re comfortable with what they are doing.

Listen for clues that tell how much your partner is enjoying a particular maneuver. If you hear a sigh or moan, or they begin kissing you back with increased intensity, you're on the right track.Practice. Good French kissing, like good kissing of any kind, requires practice. You will get better as you do it more. In addition, the more practice you have with one person, the more comfortable you will feel kissing them and developing a style that suits both of you. Just because you may not have had a stellar first kiss doesn't mean that you and your kissing partner are romantically doomed; have patience and keep kissing slowly and gently until you fall into a rhythm that works for you.
Don't take yourselves too seriously, either. If you tried something that just plain failed, it's okay to laugh, to lightly apologize, and to try again. If you act devastated after a disappointing kiss, you'll only be making things weird for your partner, and there's no need for that.
Most first kisses, like most first attempts at love-making, aren't anything to write home about. Part of the fun is getting better at it — together.Communicate. If you really like the way your partner kisses you, let them know. If you don't like something, also let your partner know that, but approach it delicately and compliment them at the same time on something they did that you liked. If your partner is being honest and open with you, try not to overreact or get hurt, or this may make your partner feel hesitant to communicate with you in the future.
Even if the kiss goes all wrong, it can still be an intimate affair if you can both laugh about it together! The important thing is that you're both honest about how you're feeling and what you want to do to improve.
You should also communicate by telling your partner how attractive they look, and how much you like them. Make it clear how happy you are to be with the person you're with, and the French kissing will come all the more naturally.Choose an N95 face mask to filter out particles in the air. N95 face masks are a great choice for protecting your lungs from particles in the air, which could be metal fumes (such as those caused by welding), minerals, dust, or biological particles, such as viruses. You can wear one when there’s been a flu outbreak in your area, or if pollutants or a fire has made air quality poor. These masks are made of structured, lightweight foam and fit over your nose and mouth.
Specially-made versions are also available for people in industrial jobs, and surgical N95 face masks are available for those in health care professions.
The number refers to the percentage of particles that the mask can filter out. The N95 mask filters out 95% of dust and particulates.
N95 masks shouldn’t be used if oil aerosols are present, as oil damages the filter. The “N” actually stands for “Not resistant to oil.”Go with an R or P mask if you’ll be exposed to an oily atmosphere. In cases where you face exposure to mineral, animal, vegetable, or synthetic oils, look for an R or P designated mask. The “R” stands for “somewhat oil-resistant,” which means it will protect you from oil vapors for a time limit specified on the packaging. The “P” stands for “oil-proof or strongly resistant.”
These masks also come with number classifications, such as P100 and R 95. The numbers stand for the percentage of particles they filter out.
If you’re exposed to gases or vapors which are more concentrated than the exposure limits of these masks, look for a respirator that uses special canisters or cartridges to filter the air even more effectively.Try on different sizes to get the best fit. Depending on the particular N95 mask you choose, available sizes range from extra small and small to medium and large. If possible, try on a couple of sizes before you purchase one. Make sure the mask feels snug and doesn’t slip on your face, remembering that you’ll also mold it to your face for an even tighter fit. If you’re not sure, go for a smaller size to make sure the mask won’t fall off.Check with your doctor if you have a respiratory or cardiac condition. N95 face masks can make it more difficult to breathe, especially if you have a chronic cardiac or respiratory condition. Talk with your doctor to see what extra precautions you can take. You may be able to use a model with exhalation valves, which can ease breathing and lessen heat build-up in the mask, although these versions shouldn’t be used if you need to maintain a sterile environment, like an operating room. Talk to your doctor before using if you have any of the following conditions:
Breathing problems
Emphysema
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)
Asthma
Cardio-pulmonary
Immune compromised medical condition problemsBuy a NIOSH-certified N95 face mask from hardware stores or online. You can get an N95 mask at hardware or home improvement stores and pharmacies. You can also purchase directly from online retailers, like 3M. It’s important to only choose masks that are certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). These masks will have the NIOSH logo and a certification approval number on the packaging or the mask.
If you need an N95 mask for your job, your employer will likely be required to provide it.
Masks that aren’t NIOSH-certified may not provide good protection.Stock up on face masks so you’ll be ready when you need them. Face masks tend to have large spikes in demand and sell out fast during certain times, such as during an outbreak of an infectious illness or when a region experiences intense pollution. Be prepared by having some on hand for you and each of your family members at all times. Aim to have 2-3 masks per family member to be on the safe side.
Take your local environment into account when stocking up on masks. You’ll need more if you live in a big city with notable pollution problems, for example, than if you live in a more rural environment with cleaner air.Trim your facial hair before wearing your mask, when possible. If you know you need to wear an N95 mask, shave off all facial hair. It can get in the way of the mask and prevent a tight, sealed fit, which will compromise the effectiveness of the mask.
If it’s an emergency situation and you don’t have time to shave, fit the mask on as best you can.Wash your hands well before putting on your mask. Use soap and water and dry your hands well so you don’t get the mask wet. This will prevent you from accidentally contaminating your mask before you put it on.Cup the mask in one hand and place it over your mouth and nose. Place the mask in the palm of your hand so that the straps face the floor. Set it over your nose and mouth with the nosepiece fitting over the bridge of your nose. The bottom should go just under your chin.
Try to touch only the outside and edges of the mask to keep it clean.Pull the bottom and top straps over your head. If your mask has two straps, pull the bottom one over your head and secure it around your neck, just under your ears. Continue to hold the mask tightly against your face with the other hand. Then, pull the top strap over and set it above your ears.Mold the nose piece around the bridge of your nose. Set your first 2 fingertips on either side of the metal nose clip at the top of your mask. Run your fingers down both sides of the strip, molding it along the bridge of your nose.
If your mask doesn’t have a nosepiece, simply make sure the fit is tight and snug around your nose.Look for alternate solutions for children. N95 masks are not designed for children and won’t fit correctly on them. Instead, keep children inside as much as possible if air quality is poor. Take extra precautions in case of flu outbreaks, such as having kids wash their hands before meals and after sneezing or coughing. You can also try using masks made specifically for children, although they won’t be N95-designated.
Don’t use an N95 mask on children younger than age 17-18.
Older teenagers can try on an N95 mask to test the fit and comfort. If it fits well and forms a tight seal, have them try walking around with it, paying close attention to any feelings of dizziness or difficulty breathing. If these symptoms occur, have them remove the mask and go inside.Breathe through the mask and test for leaks. Set both hands against the mask and take a breath to make sure that it seals against your face. Then exhale, feeling for any leakage from the nosepiece or around the edges. If you feel air leaking from the nose area, re-mold the nosepiece. If it’s coming from the edges of the mask, adjust the placement of the straps on the sides of your head.
If your mask still isn’t completely sealed, ask a friend or family member for help, or try a different size or model.Remove your mask by pulling the straps over the top of your head. Without touching the front of the mask, pull the bottom strap over your head. Let it hang down over your chest. Then, pull the top strap over.
You can either throw the mask away or store it in a clean, sealed container or bag.
Avoid touching the mask itself, as it might be contaminated.Throw away your mask if you used it in a medical setting. If you used your mask with an ill patient, or as a way to prevent getting sick in an outbreak, the outside of your mask is likely contaminated. Disposing of it properly will ensure that you won’t come into contact with contaminated particles. Carefully hold the mask by the straps and throw it away in a trash can.Re-wear your mask as long as it stays dry and fits tightly. If you’re using the mask to protect from environmental hazards and it hasn’t come into contact with harmful germs, it should be fine to wear again. Test the seal of your mask each time you put it on to make sure it still fits snugly. Store your mask in a clean, sealed container or bag and make sure it doesn’t get bent out of shape by surrounding objects.Learn the 10 basic 5-card hands and their ranking. No matter what type of poker you play, the hands will always be the same. To start familiarizing yourself with the different hands, print out a "cheat sheet" and study it. Then, memorize the different hands so you can easily recognize them. Here are the winning poker hands, from highest to lowest:
The highest-ranking hand is a royal flush (the royal straight flush). This hand includes a 10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace of the same suit, one kind (all clubs, diamonds, hearts or spades). It can only be tied but not beaten by the royal flush of another suit.
A straight flush is made up of 5 consecutive cards of the same suit.

4 of a kind means you have 4 cards of the same rank (but different suits, of course) and a fifth card of any rank (such as 4 aces and a 9). If you have 4 aces, then no one can have any hand with an ace, so that no royal flush is available.
A full house contains 3 matching cards of 1 rank and 2 matching cards of another rank.
A flush contains any 5 cards of the same suit. These skip around in rank or sequence, but are from the same suit.
A straight contains 5 cards of consecutive rank but from more than one suit.

3 of a kind means you have 3 cards of the same rank, plus two unmatched cards.

2 pair is made up of two cards of one rank, plus two cards of another rank (different from the first pair), plus one unmatched card.

Pair means you have 2 cards of the same rank, plus 3 other unmatched cards.

High card is the lowest-ranking (called a "nothing") hand, when no two cards have the same rank, the five cards are not consecutive, and they are not all from the same suit.Tip: Keep in mind that if two people face off with the same type of hand, the hand with the higher-ranking cards wins. If the hands have the exact same ranks of cards (suit does not matter), it is a tie and the prize, if any, is split evenly.Place the blinds (starting bets) or "ante up." In poker, bets are placed at the beginning of the game in one of 2 ways. In Texas Hold’em, the player next to the dealer typically places a small blind bet that’s half of the usual minimum bet, while the player to that person’s left places a big blind that’s at least the minimum bet. As another option, each player can “ante up” the minimum starting bet, which means placing a minimum starting bet into the pool.
Aside from Texas Hold’em, most poker variants use an “ante up” system.Look at the 2 cards the dealer gives you, which is your hand. The dealer will "burn" the first card on the deck, which means placing it out of play. Then, they'll pass out 2 cards to each player. Check your cards to see what you're holding.
In poker, the dealer will burn a card every round of dealing. That way, it’s harder for players to anticipate what card is coming up and the game becomes more of a gamble.
The dealer will always pass out the cards in a clockwise direction, starting on the left.Tip: Players don’t show their hands to anyone else until they reach the showdown. Even if another player is out, it’s best to keep your cards a secret. You don’t want them to accidentally (or purposely) reveal the value of your cards.Bet, call, or raise after each round is dealt if you want to. Every time the dealer puts out new cards, you'll make a bet, with the first bet being made solely based on the two cards the players have in their hands. Betting happens in a circle – when it's your turn to bet, you have a few options. At this point you can:
Place an initial bet if no one else has yet.
Say "check" to avoid betting.
Say "call" to match the bet someone else has made.
Say "raise" to add more money to the betting pool. If you "raise," the other players will go around in a circle and choose to either "call" your new bet or fold.
Say "fold" if someone else has bet and you don't want to match their bet. If you fold, turn your cards into the dealer face-down to avoid giving the other players any advantages!Look at the “flop” to see if you have a good hand. After the first round of betting, the dealer will "burn" the top card on the deck. Then, they'll put 3 cards face up on the table, which is called the "flop." These are the community cards that every player can use to build their hand. Compare these cards and the cards in your hand, then place a bet, call a bet, or fold.
In total, the dealer will reveal 5 cards. You will have 7 cards total to use to create your best hand of 5: your two personal cards in your hands, and the five community cards on the table. While your luck can turn later on in a game, take some time to analyze the table after the "flop" – are you well-positioned to end the game with a good hand?
Depending on the rules where you’re playing, you can also draw replacement cards for the cards in your hand. This is usually done during or just after the betting round.Check the “turn” card after the second round of betting. The dealer will "burn" the top card, then they'll place 1 card face up next to the flop. This is called the “turn” card or the “fourth street” card. Check all of the cards on the table and the cards in your hand to see if you want to bet, call, or raise.
Your game may also allow a card exchange at this point, but this isn’t typical in professional games.
As you look at the cards, think about the possible hands other players might have. For instance, if all 4 cards on the table are spades, then any player who has a spade in their hand will have a flush, which means they have 5 cards from the same house.
Similarly, if the cards on the table are 5,6,7, and 8, then anyone with a 4 or 9 will have a straight.
If you have nothing good in your hand but the cards on the table make for an easy winning hand, then you may want to fold, as it’s likely another player has a winning card.Examine the "river" card and decide on the hand you'll play. After the dealer "burns" the top card on the deck, they'll put 1 last card face up next to the “turn” card. This final card is called the “river.” Check your hand and the community cards to decide on your best 5-card hand. Then, bet, call, or fold.
If the rules allow it, you may be able to exchange your hand 1 final time before or after betting. However, this isn’t common in professional games.Reveal each player’s hand clockwise in the final “showdown.” After each player calls, folds, or bets in the last round, each remaining player will participate in the “showdown.” Starting to the left of the dealer, all players involved will reveal their cards face up. Then, everyone looks at the turned over hands to see who has the highest value hand to win the entire pot.
If there is a tie, the tied players split the pot.
If you fold your hand, then you don’t have to show your cards.
In Texas Hold’em, there are 5 cards on the table and 2 cards in your hand. You can create any 5-card combination using these 7 cards. The remaining cards aren’t counted.
If you want to play the cards on the table only, this is called “playing the board.” However, it’s an option that everyone has, so it may not be the best strategy.Guesstimate the risks on your starting hand. Look at your cards to see what you’re holding. Check for a pair, 2 consecutive numbers, cards that are from the same house, or face cards, which may be good cards. Then, decide if it’s worth placing a bet to see what the community cards will be.
You should almost always raise when your hand is a pair, face cards, or aces. An ace and a king or an ace and a queen are strong hands as well. If you have these hands, bet before the flop to raise the value of the pot.
If the card you need doesn’t turn up, you can either bluff or fold. Sometimes, with good bluffing skills and some luck, a bad hand can win the whole game.Start the bidding with the player to the left of the big blind or dealer. On the first round, bidding starts to the left of the big blind. In later rounds, the bidding starts to the left of the dealer. From there, the bidding goes clockwise.
If you’re playing a game with an ante instead of a blind, always start betting with the player to the left of the dealer.Call the bet if you want to stay in but don’t have great cards. This means you want to stay in the game but don’t want to raise the bet. When you call, match the bet of the person before you by adding your chips or money to the pot. Your turn is now over.
If the flop comes and you’re holding a hand that doesn’t play, check and fold. You don’t want to keep betting money at a hand that won’t win.
If the flop comes and you have a strong hand, bet at it. This will force weaker hands out and raise the value of your pot.Raise the bet if you have a good hand. When the bet comes to you, tell the other players you want to raise. Then, say how much you are betting and place your money or chips into the pot. This ends your turn.
Say, “I raise the bet to $30.”
You can’t raise the bet above the maximum for your game.Variation: You might decide to go ahead and raise the bet to trick everyone into thinking you have good cards. This is called “bluffing.” It’s a strategy used to win a hand even with bad cards. You can “bluff” at any point in the game, but it’s a risky strategy because your bluff might get called.Fold if the current bet is too high or you have a bad hand. This means quitting the round of poker. To fold, place your cards face down on the table and say, “I fold.” Then, add your cards to the discard pile.
Don’t show your cards when you fold during a game, as this can spoil which cards are out of play. That may give certain players an upper hand.
The key to being successful at poker is knowing when to fold your hand and accept a smaller loss or when to hold onto it and risk a larger loss for a chance to win the pot.Decide if you want to draw any cards (if the game allows it). Look at your cards and decide if you want to play this hand. If you’d like to try for better cards, discard the cards you don’t want. Then, draw replacement cards from the draw pile at the center of the table. 
You can discard as many cards as you’d like.
You may not be allowed to draw new cards when playing Texas Hold’em, so check the rules for your game before you start playing.Play only with money you’re willing to lose. When you are learning, you should never gamble more than you would consider acceptable to lose. During the game, don’t add to your bankroll or dive back in after losing everything you planned to gamble. Wait until you’re comfortable losing that amount again before you play another game.
The general rule of thumb is you should be able to easily afford to lose 200 bets at the highest limit. So if the limit is $5 bets, then your bankroll should be $1000, and stop there.
Track your wins and losses if you start getting more serious about poker. This will help you figure out whether you are winning or losing in the long run.
Remember that you must keep records and pay taxes on your gambling income to avoid legal trouble.Learn to read basic tells. Playing your opponents is arguably even more important than playing your cards in poker. This is a more advanced aspect of the game, but it’s always good to be aware of players’ tells—especially your own. Watch for betting patterns such as betting early, very often (probably with weak hands), or late in a hand (as intimidation). Physical tells can also give you an estimation of your opponent’s strength of hand and help you keep your own strategy secret by avoiding such patterns.
Some classic tells include shallow breathing, sighing, nostrils flaring, flushing red, eyes watering, blinking, swallowing excessively, or an increasing pulse seen in the neck or temple.
A hand over the mouth is usually to conceal a smile, while shaking hands usually reveal nerves.
If a player glances at his or her chips when the flop comes, they probably have a strong hand.
If a mediocre player tries to impress you by staring you down, they are likely bluffing.Identify conservative players from aggressive players. This will help you determine players' betting patterns and read them more easily. You can tell if players are more conservative by noticing those folding early—evidently only staying in a hand when their cards are good.
Very conservative players won’t lose as much money, but they're easily spotted by more experienced players. Because they tend to avoid high betting, they can often be bluffed into folding.
Aggressive players are risk takers that often bet high early in a hand before seeing how the other players are acting on their cards.Practice and watch others play to develop quick instincts. The more you play and watch, the faster and better you’ll get. Since every poker game is different, it’s important to develop good instincts rather than try to memorize and apply tricky systems. Observe experienced players and imagine how you’d react in their position. Then, watch how the experienced players react to build your own instincts.
While you do this, consider how successful you’d have been if you were playing and reacted as you did. Would you have won, or would you have lost? Then, decide how you can improve your strategy going forward.Shuffle the cards and cut the deck before they’re dealt. Shuffling the cards mixes them up to make the game more fair. To do a basic shuffle, split the deck into 2 stacks. Next, hold a stack in each hand close together and facing each other. Use your thumbs to flip through the cards, combining the deck into one. After the cards are shuffled, get someone who isn’t the dealer to cut the deck by separating it into 2 stacks and placing the bottom stack on top.
Do several shuffles to make sure the cards are mixed up.
You can cut the deck more than once if you’d like.
The dealer typically does the shuffling and bets last, which is called the “button” position. After each hand, you’ll pass the dealer/button position to the next player on the left. If the dealer is always the same person, like in a casino, the button position will still pass clockwise around the table.Say “check" to skip placing a bet or simply tap the table twice with two fingers. You can say this if you are the first better or if all those already betting have checked. If you say "check" when it's your turn at the beginning of a new hand, that means you are choosing not to place a bet at that point. Instead, you pass the chance to open to the next player.
In the following rounds, if you say “check,” that means you’re staying with the bets you already paid into the pot during this hand, and you won’t pay more until someone else raises during their turn.
If another player does raise on that hand, then you nor anyone else can say "check" or maintain your “check”—so when the play comes around to you again you have to either match or raise the latest bet or fold your hand.Say "I open" if a bet hasn’t been placed yet and you want to open betting. For example, you could raise the ante $1 or at least the agreed minimum raise. If you choose not to open, take turns in clockwise order, until someone else has opened or every player checked. If everyone checks, then it is time to choose to discard and draw 1 to 3 cards, or "hold pat" on the cards you have. When there are fewer than 3 cards available to draw, replacements will be drawn.
The dealer will have to shuffle the discards and add them to the bottom of the draw stack.Say “call” if you want to bet the same as the last person. Calling means making a bet equal to the last bet or raise. For example, if the person right of you just bet $10 and it's now your turn, you would say "call" or “I call” to match that bet. Then you would place $10 in chips or cash in the pot.“Raise” to increase the current betting amount. This is also known as “sweetening the pot.” Raise or re-raise requires finishing this round and making another round to now allow any others to "call" or "raise" the amount of that last bet to stay in the game, or else "fold". The ones who already called can check on this turn and the hand is finished unless someone re-raises.
If someone before you bets $20 and you think you have a winning hand or you want to bluff, you can raise when it's your turn by saying “raise to $30.”
However, do not say “I see your 20, and I’ll raise you 10…” Despite being popular in movies, this is actually frowned upon as sloppy table talk.Say “I fold” when you're ready to quit a hand. Folding means forfeiting your cards and giving up that pot with any bets you've made into it. Wait to be dealt into the next hand if you have chips or have not reached your limit of losses. To fold when it’s your turn, put your cards face down on the table and place them onto the discard pile.
You can fold at any point in a hand when it’s your turn.“Cash-in” when you’re ready to quit the game. This means exchanging your poker chips for money. If you still have chips but don’t want to play anymore, take your chips to the bank and tell them you’re ready to cash in. The bank will determine how much money your chips represent, then they’ll hand you cash.
You can usually return and watch the game after you cash in.Master the basics of five-card draw. This variation has optional rules that can be agreed on before the game begins, such as whether or not to use jokers and wildcards, or which cards are high and low. The object of the game is similar to Texas Hold ‘Em: to get the best 5-card hand, but within the bounds of the your own 5-card hand, without common cards.
Determine the betting structure by deciding if you’ll play fixed-limit, pot-limit, or no-limit.
Decide on the dealer by asking "Who deals first?". Depending on the group you’re with and where you’re playing, a dealer may be elected or each player could draw for the position. The organizer or host may also choose to deal first.Learn 3-card draw. In this game, the players start by making an ante bet. The dealer and each of the players then get 3 cards, and the players must decide whether to make a play bet or fold. Finally, the dealer reveals their cards for a showdown and whoever has the best hand wins.
Like with 5-card draw, you can choose to vary the rules if you’re playing at home. For instance, jokers can be wild, meaning they can be used in represent any card value.Study some of the more obscure variations. If you really get into the game or just want to impress others with your knowledge of poker, learn the rules of the other variations. These include Straight Poker, 5-Card Stud, 7-Card Stud, Lowball, Omaha, Pineapple, Crazy Pineapple, Cincinnati, and Dr. Pepper.

Get caught looking (briefly) at the other person's lips.
Don't purse your lips.  Keep them softly parted — not so much that you could breathe comfortably through the opening, but enough that you could bite your bottom lip easily.

Make your mouth appealing.  Use chapstick or lipgloss to smooth over flaky lips, and keep your breath fresh with mints or spray. Avoid gum, which you might have to spit out awkwardly if the other person goes in for a kiss.Break the kiss barrier (optional).  If you're feeling brave, test the waters with a small kiss on the hand or the cheek.  If the other person seems interested, it's probably safe to proceed with a kiss on the mouth.

If you're kissing a girl: Take her hand and slowly lift it to your mouth.  Gently press your lips into the back of your hand for 2 or 3 seconds before breaking away.

If you're kissing a guy: Lean in and plant a 2- or 3-second kiss on his cheek.  Keep your lips soft, and avoid puckering like you would if you were kissing a family member.  If you want your intentions to be extra clear, aim for the part of his cheek just to the side of his lips.Set the mood with a romantic compliment.  Go big and pay the other person the sincerest compliment you can think of.  If you get it right, the other person might take the lead and lean in to kiss you.
Say it in an intimate way. Lower the volume and tone of your voice slightly, and lock eyes.  Not only does this communicate that you have deep feelings for this person, it entices him or her to come closer to hear you.
Focus on an alluring quality.  Even if you truly think that your date is an amazing basketball player, now might not be the best time to bring it up.  Instead, base your compliment on how you see your date as a romantic partner.  Try these lines:
"You are SO beautiful."
"Your eyes drive me crazy."
"I love to see you smile."
"I am so lucky to be with you right now."Consider asking for a kiss directly. If all else fails, go for broke and state your intentions. If your date hasn't picked up on any of your hints and you're dying to lock lips, you might as well be straightforward and just ask if you can kiss him or her.  Don't worry, though — you can be direct while still being romantic and compelling.  Try these phrases if you're at a loss for words:
"I'd love nothing more than to kiss you right now."
"I'm sorry if this is too forward, but I'd really like to kiss you."
"I want to kiss you so much that it is just about killing me."Go in for the kiss.  Don't waste any time once you have the go-ahead — close your eyes, lean in and smooch!  The next sections will discuss some kissing techniques, as well as how to handle kissing in different dating situations such as a first kiss or kissing after a date.Keep your lips soft.  Tense puckers are for family members or people you're obligated to kiss, but keeping your mouth slightly parted and soft communicates a sense of openness.Do a few soft kisses.  Start slow with soft, gentle kisses and skip the tongue and the teeth — for now.  If your partner seems receptive, you can move forward to French kissing.
Try to avoid letting your lips smack.  The noise can be distracting, and might break your immersion in the moment.  If you do find yourself smacking, slow down and part your lips a bit more.
Stay light at first.  Avoid smashing your lips against your date's mouth — for now.  Kissing softly and gently gives the other person the chance to stop if it's uncomfortable, as well as allowing you to gauge his or her interest.Stay at a manageable level of saliva.  Slobbery puppies are the last thing you want your date thinking of while you kiss him or her.  Avoid this fate by swallowing excess saliva occasionally.  If you notice that your lips are a bit too wet, pull away and discreetly purse them to bring the extra spit back into your mouth."Lock" lips.  If your initial kisses have gone well, try a lip lock, which can lead to closer kisses (and is a nice gateway for French kissing). Basically, you'll "stack" your lips so that (for instance) it looks like this:
Your lower lip
Your partner's lower lip
Your upper lip
Your partner's upper lip
At first, putting your partner's lower lip between yours is the safest bet.  Most people have larger lower lips, making them easier to grab gently with your lips.Make sure to breathe.  Ideally, you'll be able to breathe softly through your nose while you're kissing.  If that's not possible, though, break away for a second to take a breath.
Don't feel self-conscious about being out of breath or needing to take a break for a second.  Breathing hard is an indication that you're nervous and excited, which your partner will probably find flattering.Use your hands. Don't just let your hands hang at your sides like two limp fettuccini noodles — put them to good use!
Place your hands lightly on your partner's shoulders or around his or her waist. (In Western culture, girls generally put their hands on a boys shoulders while he puts his hands around her waist.)
Take the intimacy up a notch by pulling your partner in closer.
Put your hands on the sides of his or her face, using your thumb to sweep across the cheekbone, or put one hand under his or her chin and tilt it upward.
Another seriously sensual move is to put both hands around the back of your partner's head and tangle them in his or her hair, gently pulling.Test using tongue.  Once you're in a lip lock with your partner's lower lip between both of yours, lightly run the tip of your tongue over it.  If you can move it slowly, even better.
See how your partner responds.  If he or she presses in closer or returns the gesture, you're probably clear to keep increasing the intensity of the kiss.  If your date pulls away, maybe it's best to pull back the tongue for now and stick to lips-only kisses.Try French kissing (optional).  Using your tongue during a kiss is, in Western culture, referred to as a French kiss. Why do the French get the credit? Who knows! Here's how to get started:
Sweep your tongue along the inside of your partner's lower lip.  Try to move slowly and lightly at first, increasing speed and pressure only if your partner seems to respond well.
Slide the tip of your tongue inside your partner's mouth and gently move it against the tip of his or her tongue. Use light, darting motions and keep your tongue moving — letting it sit limply in your partner's mouth isn't appealing and will bring a quick end to the kissing.
Try deeper and harder strokes if your partner seems responsive.Mix it up. Don't feel obligated to keep the intensive tongue activity going forever.  Alternate soft and hard, slow and fast, deep and shallow.  You can even go back to using only your lips for a few minutes.
Alternating your technique will keep your partner from being able to predict what's coming next.  Maintaining this sense of surprise and spontaneity helps your kisses avoid becoming stale.Gently nibble your partner's lips (optional).  Teeth aren't a necessary element of kissing, but a grazing them over your partner's lip can introduce another unexpected element.  Here are some quick pointers:
Keep the pressure as light as possible.  Remember that you're aiming to nibble, not bite.
Move slowly.  Again, keeping your pace gentle will help prevent accidentally chomping on your partner's lip.
When your lips are locked, place your teeth over your partner's lower lip and slowly pull back until your teeth are almost at the end of the lip.  Pause for a moment, then resume kissing as usual.
Don't break out the biters too much.  They should be an occasional perk, not the main attraction.
Be prepared for rejection.  Not everyone likes a side of teeth with their kisses.  If your partner doesn't respond well, try not to be too offended — it's probably a matter of personal taste, not a lapse in your technique.Increase the intensity with occasional breaks.  Pull away for a moment to look into your partner's eyes, whisper something in his or her ear, or simply catch your breath and marvel at your good fortune.
Instead of putting a damper on the action, these small moments can actually make kissing more intimate. It gives your partner the sense that you see him or her as a complete person, and not simply something to kiss.Try to pick a trustworthy partner.  Smooching someone you trust can ease a lot of the anxiety of your first kiss.  If you knew you were giving someone his or her first kiss you'd try to be patient and understanding, so expect the same of your partner.
Keep in mind that an awkward first kiss isn't the end of the relationship (or the world).  Actually, it can build intimacy through having a shared experience.  As long as you can laugh it off, you'll be fine.
Remember, everyone has gone through having their first kiss.  Odds are that most people are more awkward about it than you'll be, even if you don't know it.Prepare your mouth.  Use chapstick or lipgloss to smooth over chapped lips, and brush your teeth and tongue well.  If your mouth feels a little stale, use breath mints or spray to freshen up.
Knowing that your mouth is clean and appealing can help you feel more confident about kissing.
That being said, though, don't feel like you need to obsess over cleanliness.  Most mouths just "taste" warm, unless you've recently eaten something pungent (like onions or garlic) or you've just woken up in the morning.Don’t rush. You only get one first kiss! Unless you’re both so overwhelmed with desire that you have to kiss right now or the world will end, draw it out. It can be tremendously exciting and sensual to tease the kiss before it happens, keeping eye contact the whole time.Let the other person take the lead (optional).  If you're nervous about not knowing the right techniques, let your partner initiate what happens during the kiss.  Imitate what he or she does until you're comfortable trying your own moves.

Moshe Ratson, MFT, PCC			Marriage & Family Therapist				What kind of hints work? Moshe Ratson, couples counselor, tells us: "To show someone you're interested in kissing, try lowering your voice and leaning in slightly while you speak. You can even whisper into their ear.  Get physically closer than normal. Also consider mirroring your partner's body language."Take a few calculated risks.  As you become more comfortable with kissing, try to take the lead on initiating kisses or working on new techniques.  If your partner doesn't respond well, simply write it off as personal preference and try something else.Get close. Since the possibility of a goodbye kiss always beckons—and assuming it’s your desire—it’s best to start getting close sooner than later. Otherwise, you will find yourself saying your goodbyes with what feels like a chasm between you, making the swoop in for the kiss very conspicuous and awkward.
Guys, this is when you get the dreaded last-minute-turn-and-kiss-on-the-cheek routine, which is second only to the phrase, “You remind me of my brother,” for most-deflating date ending. As you walk your date to the car, the door, etc., put your hand (or a jacket) on your date’s shoulder or back. This breaks the touch barrier, gently lets your date know your intentions, and gives you an excuse to stand very close all at the same time.Watch your date’s reaction. If your date angles his or her body away from you or speeds up to create distance, don’t try to complete the goodnight kiss—and don’t let your ego make a fool of you. Simply flash a big smile, thank them for the lovely time, and go about your business. It could simply be that your date isn’t ready to kiss yet.Maintain eye contact. Making eye contact while standing close is a universally acknowledged indicator that a post-date kiss is about to take place.
If the eye contact becomes too long, break and reestablish it as necessary; it’s better to let your eyes dart around than subject your date to an interrogation-style stare down. One good way to break eye contact while maintaining the romance is to glance down at your date’s lips
It may feel awkward to make your desires so clear, just remember that by giving your date a heads-up, you will make the kiss go much more smoothly and improve the odds that it will turn into a glorious make out session. Trying to plant a kiss by surprise, on the other hand, may result in bumped noses and teeth, a startled pullback, and much awkwardness.Stop the conversation. When people get nervous, they often compensate by finding anything to talk about, killing the kissing opportunities.
While you shouldn’t try to end the conversation abruptly, which might come across as trying to get over with your goodbyes, you shouldn’t encourage your date to ramble, either.
Let the chatter die down by keeping your responses friendly but minimal.Consider breaking the kiss barrier. If everything is going well but you’re not quite ready to dive into full-blown romantic kissing, lean in for a hug and kiss the person on the cheek.
Don’t confuse this with a friendly peck smack in the middle the cheek; make your feelings clear by placing the kiss close to the ear or mouth and letting your lips linger for a second, or whisper something flirty in their ear with lips touching. This will help the other person know that the kiss isn't meant in a platonic context.Keep it simple. If this is a first kiss with this person—or, more importantly still, a first date—don’t overdo it. Keep your lips softly parted and either plant a straightforward kiss on your partner’s lips or up the ante by gently locking lips.
Resist the temptation to kiss hard or with tongue, unless you've been chasing this person for quite some time.  It might seem too forward and shut down future opportunities.Follow your date’s lead. Pay attention to how your date responds and moves during the kiss. If they lean closer or linger, you may be able to transition into more romantic kissing; otherwise, end the kiss by pulling slowly back, reopening your eyes to make eye contact, and smiling.Pucker your lips. Having your lips puckered keeps them tight and somewhat closed, indicating that you're unwilling to open your mouth for more intimacy. Most people will read a pucker as strictly platonic.
To know if you're puckering your lips correctly, kiss in the air. How loud is the kissing noise? It should be a clearly audible "pop" of your lips as you part them while sucking air in. A romantic kiss will barely make this noise because your lips are much more relaxed.Make your intentions clear. If you want to kiss someone on the cheek and that someone is at risk of misinterpreting your intentions, make it clear that you're not going for the mouth by turning your head off to the side before you lean in. Try to plant the kiss squarely in the middle of the cheek so that it's not veering for more romantic areas such as the ear or mouth.
If you're uncomfortable actually kissing the other person's skin, try air kissing. Lean in so that your cheek is touching the side of the other person's cheek, and kiss the air with a few quick and audible puckers. For extra effect, pull back, switch sides, and do it again.Keep it brief. The amount of time your lips spend on the other person's cheek or lips should be limited to whatever it takes to make that kissing noise described in the previous step—nothing more. If your lips linger, it won't seem so platonic.Kiss out of respect or worship.  Bow or kneel before the other person. Look up in respect. Remain in this position during the kiss.  Take the person's hand gently and bring it close to your lips.Turn up the temperature. Yeast loves nothing better than a warm, moist climate to live its yeasty life to the fullest. If you want your dough to rise, you need to give the yeast what it wants.
Fill a baking pan with boiling water, and set it on the lowest rack in your oven. Place the container of dough on the middle rack, and close the oven door and allow the dough to rise.
Alternately, you can boil a cup of water in the microwave, then place the container of dough in the microwave with the water, and close the door. (Don't microwave the dough!)
Some people turn on the oven, and place the dough on top of the stove, covered with a damp towel. The oven keeps the surface of the stove warm, and the damp towel provides the moisture.Add more yeast. If warm and moist isn't activating the yeast (you'll know in less than an hour), you can try adding more yeast.
Open a new package of yeast, and mix teaspoon of yeast with 1 cup (240ml) of warm water (at about 110°F/43°C) and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Let this mixture proof for about 10 minutes, until it gets 1/2- to 1-inch of foam. If this fails, you will need to get fresh yeast and try again.
While proofing this yeast mixture, gently warm the flat dough to about 100°F (38°C) by placing the bowl in a warm place.Blend in the starter. Adding more flour as necessary: a ratio of 60% flour to 40% liquid is usually a good ratio for bread doughs so add sufficient flour needed to balance. Knead the active yeast mixture into the dough, then let it rise in a warm, moist place.
This can also be an indicator to see if your yeast is not active. This method makes the yeast very active so when it is added to the dough, it should rise perfectly. If your dough still fails to rise, it will indicate the yeast is not at fault: there is another problem.
You can also do this at the beginning of the recipe next time you make a different yeast dough.Knead in more flour. Check whether the dough is sticky to the touch. If so, this is probably under-kneaded dough. Knead in additional flour until smooth and silky to the touch and dough no longer sticks to your hand. Let rest and rise in warm wet environment. Repeat if needed. You may need  to let dough rest overnight before shaping and baking.Knead the dough properly. There's an art to kneading. Too little, and you may not distribute the yeast through the dough. The dough will then be too weak to be able to rise. Too much kneading may make the dough so tough that it cannot expand. The dough should feel smooth and elastic, not tight like a rubber ball, or soft like biscuit dough.Find the problem. Consider several of the following points to do some preliminary diagnosis. It may be that a simple correction to the environment can fix the problem with no further effort.
Check the dough and yeast type. Some sourdough cultures are very slow rising and may need several hours to rise. A
Make sure the yeast is still within its expiration date.Powdered yeast in packets last a long time, as does storing jars of dry yeast in the freezer. However, both fresh and dried yeast have a lifespan after which they will function weakly, or not at all.Check the environment. The ideal temperature is approx 100°F (38°C) and high humidity. Move too far out of that range, and your yeast will not be happy.Check the flour types. Breads made with cake or all-purpose flour, have low gluten and protein contents, so your dough may rise—and then collapse.
This can also happen if you have a dough that has too high a ratio of water to flour.
Some flours contain antifungal ingredients to prolong shelf life. As yeast is a proud member of the Fungi kingdom, this will most definitely inhibit growth.
Organic, additive-free unbleached white bread flour works best for a good loaf of white bread.
Heavier flours such as whole wheat, rye and other types of whole-grain flour will result in a heavy loaf that does not rise as much as fine white bread flour.Let the dough rest. Do not disturb the dough while it is rising, especially if it is a particularly wet dough.Use the proper container. The pan, banneton, or tray you use will make a difference. Too large, and the dough has nothing to push against when rising, so won't rise upwards. Instead, it will spread and possibly collapse.
Small buns do well placed fairly close together.Check your ingredients. Some spices, such as cinnamon, are naturally anti-fungal.
For sweet fruit buns or cinnamon rolls, you usually want a fast rise, as the cinnamon will eventually kill the yeast off.
Some dried fruits also are coated with antifungals as a preservative. Organic dried fruits are expensive but much better for baking. What many bakers do is use standard dried fruit but don't add it till the final proofing.Ease up on the salt. Salt is a required ingredient for developing the gluten proteins that make for a smooth elastic dough, but too much will kill the yeast. Add only the required amount, and add it to the flour, not the water, at the beginning.Open Google Chrome . Its app icon resembles a red, yellow, green, and blue sphere.Click ⋮.

If you’re not careful, you’ll be left with hands that match your hair color! To avoid this, slip on a pair of rubber kitchen gloves or disposable latex gloves to keep the dye from soaking into your skin.
If you do stain part of your skin, there are a few ways to remove the Kool-Aid stains.Select your desired color of Kool-Aid. Choose your favorite color, or mix 2 together to create a custom color. Grape can create a lovely violet purple. Tropical punch creates a brighter red while cherry produces a deeper red. In the cooler spectrum, blue raspberry results in blue and lime creates a bright green. Mixed berry can result in a light blue.
Note that the colors can appear differently on different hair types and base colors. For instance, grape Kool-Aid will leave a light pinkish violet on light blonde hair when left on for just 30 minutes. However, grape Kool-Aid will show up as a deep reddish purple on dark brown hair after 1 hour.
If you have brown hair, vibrant reds usually show up the best. You can also try deep purple and dark blue! You won’t be able to get a lighter color than your natural shade without first bleaching your hair, though.Empty 1 or more sugar-free Kool-Aid packet(s) into a small bowl. If you have very long hair, or if you want a heavily saturated hue, use 2 or more packets. The unsweetened version will be much less sticky than the artificially sweetened kind, enabling you to apply the dye more evenly and smoothly.
If you’re not sure how your hair will take to the dye, start with just 1 packet. You can always follow up with another dye session using a few more packets to build up the color.
If you’re mixing colors, stir together 2 packets. For instance, try black cherry mixed with strawberry for a vibrant red, or strawberry and grape for red-violet. You could also try blue raspberry and lemon-lime to create turquoise.Stir in hot water to dissolve the powder. Start by pouring 1 to 2 US tbsp (15 to 30 mL) of hot water into the bowl. Mix together the water and powder, stirring constantly with a spoon until the powder dissolves.
A good rule of thumb is to use 1 US tbsp (15 mL) of water per packet of Kool-Aid.
Try not to add too much water, or else the mixture will get too runny to paint onto your hair.Add hair conditioner to the mixture to form a creamy paste. Once the Kool-Aid is completely dissolved, squeeze a dollop of hair conditioner into the bowl and mix it in. Start with ⁄4  c (59 mL) of conditioner and adjust the measurements until a creamy paste forms.
The creamy consistency of your dye paste will make the dye easier to handle and apply to your hair. Plus the conditioner will help the dye spread through your hair.Cover your shoulders and workspace with an old towel. The dye will stain your clothes, so keep yourself protected with an old towel or t-shirt that you don’t mind getting stained. Consider wrapping a large garbage bag around your shoulders and clipping it in place to keep any moisture from getting through.
Also protect your workspace with another towel or garbage bag in case any dye drips onto your chair, the table, or the floor.Divide your hair into 3 to 6 sections. Start with clean, dry hair and use clips or hair ties to pull back parts of your hair. For even coverage, divide your hair into multiple smaller sections which you’ll apply the dye to.
Try dividing your hair vertically into left and right segments, and then dividing each of these into 3 horizontal sections (top, middle, and bottom).
Alternatively, divide your hair into left, right, and center sections and work your way from side to side.
Or, start by exposing the hair at the nape of your neck and piling the rest of your hair up at your crown. Pull out small sections as you work your way from your nape up to your crown.Paint the Kool-Aid paste onto each section of hair, from the roots to the tips. Either use gloved hands or a hair dye brush to apply the dye paste onto your hair. Start with 1 section and massage or paint the dye into your roots. Then spread the dye down the strands, all the way to the tips, until the first section is completely coated.
Tie back each dyed section and proceed until all sections are evenly coated.
All of your hair must be saturated with dye otherwise the powder will just wash out, without coloring your hair.
If you’re dyeing your own hair, you might want to enlist the help of a friend. It can be hard to evenly coat the hair at the back of your head.Wrap your hair in saran wrap. Secure the hair at your crown with hair clips. Wind a few long sections of saran wrap around your hair to hold it in place, off of your face and shoulders. Alternatively, try a plastic grocery bag or resealable food storage bag. The plastic will help trap in the moisture and prevent the dye from spreading and staining.
Secure the plastic wrap with tape for extra hold.
This step is especially useful if you plan to leave the dye on your hair for a few hours.Wait anywhere between 15 minutes and 5 hours for the desired saturation. If you have very light, fine hair and just want a subtle tint in your hair, leave the dye on for 15 or 30 minutes. But if you have darker or thicker hair, or if you want a deeply saturated dye job, wait a few hours before removing the dye.
If you’ve used more Kool-Aid packets, it’s ok to leave the dye on for a shorter amount of time.Rinse the Kool-Aid dye paste out of your hair with cold running water. Remove the saran wrap and turn on cool running water in a shower or sink. Rinse all of your hair, from the roots to the tips, under the water until all of the dye paste is washed out. Continue rinsing your hair until the water runs clear (or just a pale tint is left).
It may take between 10 and 20 minutes to get the water to run clear.
Warm or hot water may more quickly wash out some of the pigment from your newly-dyed strands.
Don’t use shampoo when you rinse out the dye. This could wash out and fade some of the color.Blow-dry or air-dry your freshly dyed hair to see the final results. Remove all the moisture from your hair, either with a hairdryer or by letting it dry naturally. Once your strands are completely dry, you’ll be able to see the final results of the Kool-Aid dye! Have fun styling and rocking your new ‘do.
To make your temporary color last as long as possible, wash your hair in cold water instead of hot water.
It’s ok to use warm water and heat styling tools, but keep in mind that the heat will cause the dye to fade faster.
You may need to experiment with the dye process a few times to get the balance right for your hair color. Just remember that if you have darker hair, the effects will be more subtle.Lay a piece of saran wrap or aluminum foil behind 1 section of hair. When you’re ready to start dyeing your clean and dry hair, lift up a small section of hair and lay a rectangular piece of saran wrap or foil behind it. Place the wrap or foil right at the root of your hair and use your hand to support it from behind.
Think about how many streaks you want to add to your hair, and cut out 1 piece of saran wrap or foil for each streak before you get started.
If you’re creating narrow highlights, try picking up and painting a few thin strands on the same piece of saran wrap or foil.Use a highlighting brush to paint 1 in (2.5 cm) sections of hair with Kool-Aid dye. Pick up a dollop of the pre-mixed Kool-Aid dye paste with the brush and apply it directly to your hair. Brush it on, working from the roots to the tips, until the whole section is covered.
Support the strands from behind with your hand that’s beneath the piece of saran wrap or foil.Fold the piece of saran wrap or foil around the dye-coated strand. To prevent the dye from getting onto other parts of your hair, fold the saran wrap or foil tightly around each dyed strand.
If your hair is longer than the piece of wrap or foil, fold up the tips of your hair into a little bundle close to your roots before folding up the foil.Secure each wrapped section with a hair pin or hair tie. Once you’ve painted strand of hair and encased in saran wrap or foil, flip it up so it sits off of the under layers of hair. Slide on a hair pin onto the base or middle of the little packet of hair to secure it at your crown.
If you’re using saran wrap, try using a hair tie to create little bundles out of each section.Continue painting dye onto small sections of hair until you have enough streaks. The easiest way to add streaks is to start at your crown and pin back each foil-wrapped section as you work down your head.  Once you’ve completed as many streaks as you want, double-check that all the wrapped sections are secure.
If you have a lot of streaks, consider wrapping your hair in a plastic bag or with a few long pieces of saran wrap to hold them in place while you wait.Leave the dye on your hair for between 15 minutes and 5 hours. Depending on the natural color and thickness of your hair and the deepness of the color you want to achieve, leave the dye on for as long as you want.
If you want a really saturated hue, leave the dye on for 5 hours.
If you have light hair and you just want a light tint, don’t leave the dye on for longer than 1 hour.Rinse the dye out of your hair under cold running water. When you’re ready to rinse out the dye, unwrap each strand with gloved hands and discard the pieces of saran wrap or foil. Then use cool running water to rinse out your strands until the water runs clear.Add 3 to 4 unsweetened Kool-Aid packets to 2  c (470 mL) of hot water. Instead of making a creamy paste that you’ll paint onto your hair, you’ll create a dye bath in which you’ll dip the ends of your hair. Empty the Kool-Aid packets into a bowl of hot water and stir to dissolve the powder. Allow the water to cool slightly, for around 3 to 5 minutes.
Choose whichever Kool-Aid color you want, or mix 2 together for a custom shade.
Use more packets for more saturated color, especially if you have dark hair.Part your hair down the middle to create 2 pigtail sections. Make sure your hair is clean and dry before you dye it. As you’re waiting for the water to cool, divide your hair into 2 sections, a right and a left section. Put 1 section in front of each shoulder, and use a hair tie to secure each section into pigtails.Dip the ends of each pigtail into the dye bath. Keep your strands submerged in the bowl of Kool-Aid dye for about 15 to 30 minutes. If you have darker hair or want a deeper color, leave your hair in the dye bath longer. But if you have light or fine hair, 15 minutes might be enough to give your ends a bright pop of color.
Try dipping your hair into the dye bath a few times for a deeper color. This also helps if you want to create a softer division between your dip-dyed ends and the rest of your hair.Scrunch your damp strands with a paper towel to remove the excess liquid. Once the time is up, pull your pigtails out of the dye bath and squeeze the excess liquid back into the bowl. Use a paper towel to squeeze the remaining moisture from your hair.
Make sure you’re still wearing gloves during this process, as the Kool-Aid can stain your hands.Wrap the strands in a plastic bag if you want to let the dye soak in longer. For a richer color, or for darker hair, let the dye seep into your strands for a while longer. Use a hair tie to secure the plastic bag or a long strand of saran wrap around your dip-dyed ends. This will hold in some of the moisture while the dye permeates your hair. Keep this in place for up to 2 hours, or until your strands start to get dry.
If you want to leave the dye on for up to 5 hours, the method of painting on a dye paste containing hair conditioner would be a better choice.
Conditioner keeps the dye from drying out, whereas the dye bath liquid will evaporate after a short while.Rinse out your hair until the cool water runs clear. Without using any shampoo, rinse your hair thoroughly under cool water to remove all of the dye. Keep rinsing for about 10 or 20 minutes until the water runs clear, or very close to clear.
Once the dye is rinsed off, air-dry or blow-dry your hair to see the final results.Use the toilet first. The purpose of the bidet is to help clean off after toilet use. You can use the bidet in conjunction with toilet paper, or you can use the bidet on its own. Some people believe that using a bidet is a hygienic substitute for toilet paper, but many choose to use both.Find the bidet. Sometimes, the bidet is located near the toilet, attached to the wall: it looks something like a low sink or a toilet with a faucet. However, many modern bidets are built into the toilet seat, so you don't need to get up to straddle another fixture.
There are three main types of bidet: the standalone bidets found in Europe, the handheld bidets found in some households, and the toilet seat bidets, embodied on the seat cover or fixed on back or side toilet rim, called add-on bidets, that are common in Asia.
Standalone bidet: These bidets are separate fixtures which usually sit right next to the toilet. Sometimes, however, you'll find them across the room, or down the hall. Either way, you will need to use the toilet, then stand up and move over to the bidet. This is the original model of the bidet that originated in 18th-century Europe.
Add-on side-toilet rim or seat bidets: Many bathrooms in Asia and America don't have the space to accommodate a separate fixture next to the toilet – so many toilets are designed with built-in bidets or fixtures that fit over the toilet side rim or the seat. This way, you don't need to get up to clean yourself.
Handheld bidet:  A bidet that hangs on the wall, and must be manually moved to the desired position to use.Straddle a standalone bidet. On most standalone bidets, you can choose to face the bidet's water controls – or you can face away from them, as you would on a toilet. It is usually easier to control the temperature and flow of the water if you face the controls. You will be able to see the water as it comes out, so you might have a simpler time cleaning yourself.
If you are wearing pants, you may need to remove them to straddle the bidet facing the controls. If you don't want to completely take off your pants, try stepping out of one leg so that you can swing your legs around the bidet. In add-on bidets, things are much more straightforward. You have not to take off your pants.
In standalone bidets ultimately, the way you face may be dictated by the position of the jets, and which area of your body that you wish to clean. That is to say: if you need to clean your front, it might be easier to face the jets. If you're cleaning your rear, try facing away from the stream.Activate a toilet seat bidet. Look for the “Wash” button on the bidet’s remote control, which is usually mounted on the wall next to the toilet. You may also find the button on the toilet itself. A nozzle will appear beneath you and rinse your nether regions with a stream of water.
When you're done, simply press the “Stop” button. The nozzle will rinse itself off and retract back into the seat.
In mechanically controlled add-on bidets, you just turn the lever or pull a string and turn the mains valve.Adjust the temperature and jet strengths for comfort.  If the bidet has both hot and cold water controls, start by turning on the hot water.  Once it's hot, add the cold water until you have a comfortable temperature. Be very careful when turning on the water, as many bidets can produce a very high jet of water with only a slight turn of the control. You may find that you need to hold the control to keep the jets on.
In normally hot climates, such as the Middle East, you should start with the cold water. The water will not need time to heat up, and you may end up burning sensitive areas if you turn the hot water on first.
Be sure that you know where the water nozzle is, or you could end up with a surprise shower. If your bidet does have a spray nozzle set in the bowl (unlikely in the UK due to regulations), place your hand above it to subdue any jet of water and then either press or pull the diverter lever between or immediately behind the taps.Position yourself. Sit or squat over the stream so that the water hits the area you need to clean. You can continue to hover above the bidet, or you can sit down on it. Note that most bidets don't have seats, but are still meant to be sat upon; you just sit directly on the rim. Some bidets do not have jets: they simply have a faucet that fills the basin, much as you would fill a sink basin. In this latter case, you'll need to use your hands to manually clean yourself.
When you use a mechanically handled bidet after you had finished the "job", you don't do more than use the external mechanism to turn the water jet nozzle to the center of the bowl and turn on the water supply valve, which is on your hands reach beside the bowl. On those bidet types, as the water jet is very thin, you don't usually feel the water temperature. Of course, in some cases you can use warm water, taking the water from the bath's supply.Clean your rear and/or your genitals. If you're using a bidet with a jet, then you can mostly let the force of the water do its work. If you're using a basin, then you'll need to get your hands dirty. Either way, you might consider using your wet hands to "scrub" the area clean more quickly. You can always wash your hands afterwards!
Consider combining the bidet with toilet paper. You can use the paper at the end, to finish the job, or you can dampen the toilet paper in the water and use it to wipe yourself clean.Dry your skin. Some bidets have a built-in air dryer that you can use. Look for the "Dry" button next to the "Wash" and "Stop" features. If there's no air dryer, simply pat yourself dry with toilet paper. Many bidets have a towel on a ring positioned next to the bidet. This is meant for drying the genitals or the hands, but sometimes it is used for mopping up any splashes around the rim after rinsing it.Rinse out the bidet.  Once you are off the bidet, run the jets at very low pressure for a few seconds to rinse the basin and keep the bidet fresh. This is a matter of discretion and common courtesy.
Make sure to turn off the jets before you leave the bathroom. If you run the stream, you'll waste water.Wash your hands. Use soap and water, as you would any time after using the toilet. If you can't find soap, use whatever's available.Look for a change in color. When fresh, raw chicken has a pink, fleshy color. As it starts to spoil, the color fades to grey. If the color of the chicken begins to look duller, you should use it soon before it goes bad. Once it looks more grey than pink, it is already too late.
Raw chicken colors can range from appearing grey to having yellow spots that aren’t skin.
If you begin to cook bad chicken it may continue to look dull and not become as white.Smell the chicken. Raw chicken that has gone bad has a very potent odor. Some describe it as a "sour" smell, while others liken it to the scent of ammonia. If the chicken has begun to take on an unpleasant or strong odor of any sort, it is best to discard it.
Chicken can start to smell bad while cooking, it is best to discard it if it starts to smell less appealing.Feel the chicken. Is it slimy? The touch test is a little more difficult than the color or smell test because chicken naturally has a glossy, somewhat slimy feeling to it. If this slime remains even after rinsing the chicken under water, however, there is a good chance that the chicken has spoiled. If the chicken feels unusually sticky, it has almost certainly gone bad.Look for an ice crust. If there is a thick layer of ice around your chicken then it is no longer good. The ice crust will be thick like the ice on a freezer hasn’t been thawed in a while.  A flash-frozen chicken will not have a thick crust if done properly. If the ice is white it could be an issue with freezer burn.Check for freezer burn. Freezer burn looks like a white rash or mark on the chicken that isn’t fat.  It is rougher than the skin around it and raised slightly.
While it won’t hurt you it will make your chicken less enjoyable.Analyze the color.  A frozen chicken is harder to check for color.  It will be off color, similar to the raw or cooked chicken, a slight grey or yellowing of fat.  If it is darker than grey, that chicken belongs in the trash bin.Smell the chicken. The smell test can work for cooked chicken as well as it can for raw chicken, but it is sometimes more difficult to distinguish the smell of bad chicken if spices and other seasonings are masking the odor.
If the chicken smells like rotten eggs or sulfur, it is bad.Check for changes in color, if possible. Sometimes this is not possible if the chicken has been breaded or if the color was altered by a glaze or marinade. If chicken that cooked white begins to look grey, it is no longer safe to eat.Look for mold. Mold is one of the most obvious signs of rotten, decaying, bad chicken. If green, or black fuzz, or any organic growth of any kind has begun to form on the chicken, it has gone very bad and should be discarded immediately. Even the smell of chicken this 'off' may make you ill.Taste the chicken before you swallow it. If you feel uncertain about whether or not cooked chicken is still good, but do not want to waste it if it still is, you can cautiously take a bite. Instead of chewing and swallowing the chicken immediately, though, you should pause and carefully analyze the flavor.
If it tastes “off” or seems a little sour, spit it out and discard the rest.Check the "Sell By" date. This alone is not always a good indication of whether or not raw chicken is still good because the "Sell By" date only dictates at which point chicken can no longer be sold to consumers. Instead of relying on the "Sell By" date, it is best to use it as a means of confirming whether or not chicken you suspect has gone bad is actually past its prime.
If you purchase fresh, refrigerated chicken from a store and freeze it, it can last up to nine months past this date, as long as it was fresh when purchased.Check into how thoroughly the chicken was stored. Cooked chicken goes bad faster if it is exposed to air, and improperly stored chicken is more likely to be bad.
Chicken should be stored in shallow, airtight containers or heavy-duty freezer bags.
It could also be wrapped tightly in aluminum foil or plastic wrap.
Example: In order to remain safe to eat, the whole chicken should be cut into smaller portions and any stuffing should be removed prior to refrigeration or freezing.Find out where and for how long the chicken was stored. It depends also depends on how you stored the chicken.  After these time periods elapse, there is a higher chance that the chicken will have gone bad.
In the refrigerator, raw chicken should be used in one or two days, while cooked chicken stays good for about three to four days.
In the freezer, cooked chicken can remain good and safe to eat for up to four months while raw chicken can be good for up to a year.Write down the formula for finding the circumference of a circle using the diameter. The formula is simply this: C = πd. In this equation, "C" represents the circumference of the circle, and "d" represents its diameter. That is to say, you can find the circumference of a circle just by multiplying the diameter by pi. Plugging π into your calculator will give you its numerical value, which is a closer approximation of 3.14 or 22/7.Plug the given value of the diameter into the formula and solve.
Example problem:  You have a circle tub with a diameter of 8 feet, and you want to build a white fence that creates a 6-foot wide space around the tub. To find the circumference of the fence that has to be created, you should first find the diameter of the tub and the fence which will be 8 feet + 6 feet + 6 feet, which will account for the entire diameter of the tub and fence. The diameter is 8 + 6 + 6, or 20 feet. Now plug it into the formula, plug π into your calculator for its numerical value, and solve for the circumference:
C = πd
C = π x 20
C = 62.8 feetWrite down the formula for finding the circumference of a circle using the radius. The radius is half as long as the diameter, so the diameter can be thought of as 2r. Keeping this in mind, you can write down the formula for finding the circumference of a circle given the radius: C = 2πr. In this formula, "r" represents the radius of the circle. Again, you can plug π into your calculator to get its numeral value, which is a closer approximation of 3.14.Plug the given radius into the equation and solve. For this example, let's say you're cutting out a decorative strip of paper to wrap around the edge of a pie you've just made. The radius of the pie is 5 inches. To find the circumference that you need, just plug the radius into the equation:
C = 2πr
C = 2π x 5
C = 10π
C = 31.4 inchesTake items that you want to sell to a pawn shop. Your local pawn shop may pay you a decent price for high-value items, such as electronics, musical instruments, or jewelry. Take your items to the pawn shop and see what they are willing to give you for them. This is one way to make money without any money in hand.
Pawn shops resell your items to make money, so they may not give you as much as they are actually worth.Trade-in items for cash at second-hand stores. Some second-hand stores will also buy items, such as used clothing, CDs, DVDs, records, or books. Take some valuable items that are in good condition and see what you can get for them.These stores make money by reselling your items, so you might not get as much as they are actually worth.Have a yard sale to sell things you no longer need. Choose a day or a couple of days to have your yard sale. Advertise it in your local paper and online, such as on social media and classified websites. Then, on the day of the sale, arrange the items on tables, blankets, shelves, or in other ways in front of your home. You can arrange the items into groups by price, or price them individually.
Try to put out as many valuable, high-demand items as you are willing to let go. Good items to sell include CDs, DVDs, books, musical instruments, collectible toys, electronic equipment (computers, tablets, televisions, speakers, etc.), smartphones, video games, jewelry, clothing, shoes, and unused gift cards.Tip: Make sure that you can have a yard sale in your area. Some homeowner’s associations restrict yard sales to certain times of year. If you rent, you may need to ask your landlord for permission to have a yard sale.Sell unwanted items using a commercial website. Some sites charge a small fee or take a percentage of the sales price, but the exposure is often worth this cost. Sell any items that you have around that are in good or new condition.
Try using eBay or a similar website if you want to sell something auction-style. This may help you to get the most money for your item if it is rare or valuable.
Online retail sites like Amazon or AbeBooks.com will sometimes pay for popular items like books, DVDs, electronics, and smartphones. These sites may charge a small fee or percentage of your profit.Set up a lemonade stand. If you have enough money to buy some lemonade mix, a pitcher, and cups, then you can start a lemonade stand. Use a sturdy box or crate to set your items on, and make a sign with your price per cup on it.Make sure to use clean drinking water to make your lemonade, and add ice to it if possible!
Lemonade stands work best on a hot summer day. Set up your stand in your front yard and wait for customers to stop by.
Make sure to ask permission from your parent or guardian before you set up a lemonade stand.Offer to do yard work in your neighborhood. You can also make money doing yard work, such as mowing lawns, aerating lawns, weeding, or raking up leaves. Make fliers advertising your services and post them around your neighborhood, or go door-to-door offering your services.Set a fair price for your services and do good work for anyone willing to pay you. Check to see what other people charge and set your rate a few dollars lower than that so to entice people to hire you.Rent out a room in your home to travelers. If you live in a city or a popular vacation spot, people passing through may be looking for a place to stay. Even if you don’t live somewhere with a lot of traffic, you can still use a rental website to find people who are willing to pay to stay in your home.Check to see what other people charge to help you price your rental . For example, if a similar-sized room in your area goes for $80 per night, then charge this amount for your room.Find small paid tasks via apps. There are apps that pay you for doing marketing tasks, such as scanning products at a grocery store or completing a survey. Download one of these apps and use it to find small paid tasks you can do.
You may not be able to make much money per task this way. However, you can start right away and make some money.Warning: Stay away from apps that ask you to do something like pay a fee or supply credit card information to sign up to complete surveys. Those are almost always scams.Fill out online surveys. There are many websites devoted that connect users to free online surveys. These usually only pay at most a few dollars each, but they take very little effort and may provide fast payment.
Amazon’s Mechanical Turk program is another way to make money online by answering questions or completing simple tasks. However, the pay is usually very low, often only a few cents per task.Use your skills to do day labor. Post an ad online or on a bulletin board offering to do odd jobs or sign up with an employment agency that specializes in temporary work. You can also go where other day laborers meet and wait for employers, such as building contractors, landscapers, homeowners and small business owners. Common odd jobs people need day laborers for include:
Construction
Basic office tasks
Yardwork (raking leaves, mowing lawns, shoveling snow, cleaning gutters, etc.)
Picking up groceries or running other errands for the elderly
Doing chores (cleaning houses, clearing out an attic or shed, etc.)
Washing cars
Moving and/or packingTry pet sitting if you enjoy spending time with animals. Find friends who are going out of town and offer to take care of their pets while they’re gone. Professional boarding places tend to be expensive, so your cozy little house or apartment is a nice alternative.
Check to see what other pet sitters in your area charge to help you set your rates. Around the holidays, pet-boarders fill up, meaning you can probably charge more.
Ask your friends and family if they know anyone who needs a pet sitter. Word-of-mouth is often a great way to find jobs.Become a dog walker if you live in an area where they are in demand. You can walk dogs for people who own dogs but who are too busy to walk them. However, this can be a demanding job, especially if you end up walking a few dogs at once or if you are walking dogs throughout the day, so ensure that you have the physical stamina for this type of job.
Check to see what other dog walkers charge in your area and make your prices similar to those.
Make a flyer or post an advertisement on online classifieds boards to advertise your services as a dog walker.
Tell friends and family you are looking for work as a dog walker.Become a babysitter if you are good with children. There are websites that will connect you with people who need a babysitter. To get hired by people who do not know you, it will help to pass a CPR class, or to have a special talent or expertise for entertaining children. However, you might be able to make money more quickly just by babysitting for people you know, or by having friends refer you to others who need a babysitter.
Check to see what babysitters charge in your area and make your rates comparable.
Keep in mind that caring for children is often hard work. Make sure that this is something you enjoy doing!Sign up with a ride service company to become a private cab driver. Companies such as Uber, Grubhub and Lyft have set up services that connect drivers with people who need a ride and are willing to pay for it.  You must own a car, have a valid driver’s license, and meet other qualifications to be a driver.
It might take some time to get registered as a driver with the service, but once you are, there are opportunities to make money fast because these services are in high demand.Showcase your talents as a street performer. If you can dance, play music, mime, sing, or tell jokes, you can probably get some cash by performing in public. Put together a good act and find a place to perform. Give people a dose of live entertainment, and hopefully they'll reward you with tips.
Make sure to have a hat, cup, instrument case, or something else ready for people to drop money into.
Always check local laws before performing in a public space, since some areas have bans or restrictions on this kind of work.Pose for art students at a local art school or museum. Contact local art schools, colleges, and museums about opportunities to be a live model. Art students learn to draw the human figure by studying live models. Those that are willing to pose nude in front of others for up to 30 minutes can make money this way (usually at a per-hour rate).
People hire models of all shapes, sizes, and genders.
The website Art Model Tips maintains lists of opportunities in each state.Return bottles and cans for a refund. In some states, you can get 5 or 10 cents per can or bottle by returning them to a deposit center. There are many ways to take advantage of this opportunity:
Scrounge up all of the cans and bottles you can find around your home.
Look for cans and bottles in trash cans, along busy roads, and anywhere that people hang out (parks, stadiums, etc.).Tip: For a fun way to get some extra bottles and cans to recycle, host a bring-your-own-beverage party. When the party’s over, gather all the bottles and cans and turn them in for cash.Scrap a junk pile for cash. If you've got a big pile of scrap in your backyard, own a junked camper or other vehicle, or know of a dump site where you can legally salvage materials, you can sort and sell it to a scrap yard or recycling center in your area. Metals such as scrap steel, copper, or aluminum can fetch good prices.
If your state doesn’t have a can/bottle refund system, you can still sell aluminum cans to a scrap yard.Sell a computer you no longer want or use. Computers are full of valuable metals such as steel, aluminum, and gold. If you dismantle old computers, you can sort these metals and sell them to a salvage yard, or you may be able to find buyers who will accept the old computer as is and scrap it themselves.
If possible, get several computers to scrap to make it worth your while. For instance, offer to take outdated computers from a school doing upgrades or find junked computers.
Don’t scrap good, working computers; what you get for the scrap won’t be as much as you could get by selling the components or the entire device.Borrow money from a friend or family member. If you’re in serious need of money, you can always ask to borrow some from family or friends. Let them know why you need to borrow money, and offer to pay it back within a certain (feasible) timeframe.
Warning: Beware of loan sharks or other extortionists. Look for people that can loan you money because they want to help you, not because they want to make a profit.Use your bank’s overdraft protection if you need to make a purchase. If you have a checking or other account with overdraft protection, you might be able to overdraw on the account and take advantage of the temporary payment, when you are in need of quick cash. The bank will cover the cost, but you will have to pay it back.
This is a last resort option since you will likely incur fees as a result of overdrawing your account.Use your credit card’s cash advance feature. Some credit cards will allow you to withdraw a certain amount of cash by using it at an ATM. This can help you come up with cash in a hurry. However, the interest rates on cash advances are usually much higher than the credit card’s usual interest rate, meaning that you will eventually have to pay more.
Some credit cards also allow you to use cash advances by writing checks. The interest rates for these are sometimes lower; check with your bank or credit card issuer for details.Seek a payday loan or title loan as a last resort. Companies that offer payday and title loan services offer high interest rates (sometimes with percentages in the hundreds). If you cannot pay the loan and any interest back within the stated timeline, you risk even higher interest costs or, in the case of a title loan, the loss of your car. Avoid these types of loans in all but the direst circumstances, unless you are certain you will be able to pay the loan back. 
As an alternative, you might be able to ask your employer for a payday advance.Pick out a fresh pineapple. Look for one with firm, green leaves that have not turned yellow or brown. The skin on the fruit should be golden brown and firm to the touch. Smell the pineapple to see if it's ripe: it should emit sweet, heady smell indicating that you've chosen it at just the right time to start a new pineapple plant.
Make sure the pineapple isn't underripe. It needs to be ripe in order to produce another pineapple.
Check to make sure the pineapple isn't too ripe by tugging a little at the leaves. If they come right off, the pineapple is too ripe to plant. Be gentle.
Make sure the pineapple doesn't have scale insects around the base of the leaves. They look like small grayish black spots.Twist the leaves off the top of the pineapple. Grasp the body of the pineapple with one hand and use the other to grab the leaves at the base and twist them off. This method ensures that the base of the leaves will stay intact. It will be attached to a minimum amount of fruit, which you don't need in order for the plant to grow.
If you're having trouble twisting off the top, you can slice off the top of the pineapple. Slice off the excess fruit around the root.
Make sure the base, the very tip of the area where the leaves join together, stays intact. New roots will be sprouting from this, and without it the plant won't grow.Strip off some of the lower leaves to expose the stem. This helps the stem sprout roots once it is planted. Strip until a few inches of the stem are exposed. Cut away any remaining fruit without damaging the stem.Turn it upside down and let it dry for a week. The scars where you made a cut and removed the leaves will harden, which is necessary before you take the next step.
At this point, you can plant the crown into the soil, if you would like. While some people prefer to soak the pineapple crown first, it is not necessary.Fill a large glass with water. The mouth of the glass should be large enough to fit the pineapple crown inside, but small enough so that you can prop it up to keep it from getting completely submerged.Stick a few toothpicks into the pineapple crown. Place them across from each other near the top of the stem. Push them in just far enough so that they'll stay in place. These toothpicks are used to suspend the pineapple crown in the glass of water.Put the crown in the water. The toothpicks should rest on the rim of the glass. The stem should be submerged in the water, and the leaves should stick out the top.Place the glass in a sunny window and wait for the roots to sprout. It should take several days or up to a few weeks for white roots to poke out and begin to grow.
Keep the plant away from extreme temperatures. Don't let it get too hot or too cold.
Change out the water every few days to prevent the growth of mold.Prepare a pot of soil for the crown. Fill a 6-inch pot with light garden soil that has a 30% blend of organic matter. This has the right blend of nutrients for the pineapple plant.Plant the pineapple crown in the pot. Plant the crown when the roots are a few inches long. Wait until they've gotten long enough to take root in soil. If you plant the crown too early it won't do well. As you plant it, make sure that the base of any remaining leaves are just above soil level. Press the soil firmly around the base of the crown without  getting any soil on the leaves.Keep the plant moist and warm. It needs a sunny, warm and humid environment where the night temperatures won't drop below 65ºF (18ºC). If conditions are dry, mist the plant regularly.
You can keep the pot outside if you live in a warm climate. If you have cool winters take it indoors during the winter season and keep it in a sunny window. It's important for the plant to get a lot of sun all year round.
To help the rooting process, you can slip a plastic bag over the top of the pot. This will create a mini-greenhouse effect.Give the plant food and water. Water the soil lightly once a week.  Fertilize the plant with half-strength fertilizer twice a month during the summer.Look for flowers. It can take several years, but eventually a red cone should appear from the center of the leaves, followed by blue flowers and eventually a fruit. It takes about six months for the fruit to fully develop. The pineapple will grow from the flower, above ground, in the center of the plant.Use materials safe for consumption. You should only use food grade plastic buckets or glass carboys as your fermentation vessel. Make sure that the lid is food grade as well. A 7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel will allow for 5.5 to 6 gallon (21 to 23 L) batches.  Keep in mind that you may occasionally need to stir the batch, so containers such as buckets are often ideal.Leave extra room. You need about 1.5 to 2 gallons (5.7 to 7.6 L) worth of space in a 7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel. This allows room for the foam and gases that form during fermentation. If you don’t leave enough room, the pressure can build and pop the lid on the vessel, leading to contamination.Prepare the lid. You need to make a hole in the lid that is the right size for a rubber grommet and airlock. Push the grommet into the hole. Then fit the airlock into the top of the grommet. Install a rubber gasket around the lip of the lid to form an airtight seal between the lid and the container.Clean and/or sanitize the equipment. The fermentation vessel (and rubber stopper for glass vessels or lid for a plastic bucket), airlock, and a large spoon should be cleaned and sanitized. Fill the fermentation vessel to the brim with a sanitizer, such as iodophor, that is made for brewing and  winemaking. All these items are available at homebrewing and wine-making shops.Determine how much sugar (sucrose) to use. More sugar will result in more alcohol as long as the yeast can process it all. If you want a weaker batch (less alcohol) you can use less sugar. As a general guide, each packet of yeast will have directions that indicate how much sugar can be used.
If making two batches, be sure to use twice as much yeast (two packets).Dissolve the sugar. Mix the sugar into a pot of warm water to dissolve it. You can use tap water or bottled water. The water should be about 90 °F (32 °C). Use roughly 7 to 9 kilograms (15 to 20 lb) of sugar.
For a cleaner alcohol, use purified water.Pour the sugar solution into the vessel.  When all of the sugar has been dissolved, carefully pour the sugar and water solution into the plastic bucket or glass carboy that you are using as a fermentation vessel. For a  7.5 gallon (28 L) vessel, pour 1.5 to 2 gallons (5.7 to 7.6 L) of solution. This sugar will be broken down by the yeast to produce alcohol.
It is not necessary to sterilize the sucrose solution before fermenting, but if desired this can be done by boiling the sucrose solution for fifteen to twenty minutes. Take into account that some of the water will evaporate, so add a little more water before boiling.Add the yeast. Open the yeast packet and dump the yeast into the sugar water solution. If using a plastic bucket, stir to get an even mixture. Use a sanitized, dry funnel to help prevent a mess when adding the yeast to the narrow opening of a carboy.
Use one packet of yeast. More yeast can speed up the process, but it will not lead to a better yield of alcohol.
Do not put the yeast into the sugar water until it has cooled.  If the water is too hot it will kill the yeast.Wait one day. In the first days of fermentation, the yeast will expend most of its energy multiplying itself. Since this process requires oxygen, leave the lid off for the first 24 hours. If you cut off oxygen to the yeast immediately, the fermentation process will take much longer and may proceed sluggishly.Affix the lid to the bucket. If using a plastic bucket, tightly push the lid onto the bucket so that an airtight seal is formed. This may be somewhat difficult and may require some leverage. An airtight seal is necessary for proper fermentation.
Fermentation is an anaerobic (lacking oxygen) process.Add water to the airlock. If you haven’t already, push the airlock into the lid if using a plastic bucket. If using a carboy, now is the time to push the airlock through a drilled rubber stopper and fit the stopper snugly in the mouth of the carboy. Add clean water or vodka to the inside of the airlock so that carbon dioxide can be released from the fermenting solution while air is kept out. The drop in available oxygen will cause the yeast to stop multiplying and start producing ethanol and carbon dioxide.Let the mixture ferment. Keep the ambient temperature 70 to 80 °F (21 to 27 °C). This temperature will promote optimum performance from the yeast. It should take about two to ten days for the yeast to produce alcohol. The time required will vary depending on the type of yeast used, and on how much sugar was added. It will take longer to completely ferment more sucrose.Stop the process. The airlock will bubble a lot during active fermentation. The bubbling will slow as fermentation slows, and stop completely when all or most of the sucrose has been fermented. If you are unsure, leave the batch for another day or two. Once the fermentation is over, it is time to purify the alcohol.Clarify the fermented alcoholic liquid. After fermentation is complete, use a fining agent such as isinglass to remove suspended yeast and other material that may be present. Try to find isinglass that doesn't contain sulphites, as some people are allergic to sulphites. After adding the finings, reseal the fermenter with the lid or stopper and the airlock and allow the liquid to clarify for two or three days.
Use 0.5 to 1.0 gram of isinglass per 5 gallons (19 L) of batch.Siphon or pour off the alcoholic liquid. Siphon or carefully pour off the liquid into a glass carboy or other airtight container such as a cornelius keg. Leave the unwanted sediment behind in the fermentation vessel. You can also pour the liquid through a pad or membrane filter, such as a wine filter, to further clarify the liquid and remove residual yeast. Bottle the alcohol to preserve it.
Don't store the alcoholic liquid in a carboy for more than a month as it can become oxidized over time.
Filter through a carbon filter if desired. Use a food-grade carbon filter to remove unwanted volatiles to further purify the alcohol. If flavors were added before this point, don't use the carbon filter because it will most likely strip out the flavors.Drink responsibly. Add your alcohol directly to jungle juice or add liqueur flavorings. You can also age the alcohol in sealed bottles to improve the flavor, especially if making liqueurs. New bottles can be found at home brewing shops.
Reuse liquor bottles, wine bottles, and beer bottles, or use mason jars.Remove the Aloe vera plant from its current pot. One of the typical reasons for Aloe vera plant death is root rot. In order to determine if this is the case, you need to first take the plant out of its pot.
Loosely hold the base of the plant and the bottom of your pot. Tip the pot upside down, and continue holding the plant with your other hand. Hit the bottom of the pot with your hand or knock it against a table ledge (or other hard surface).
Depending on the size of your plant, you may need another person to help you. One person should hold the plant base with both hands, while the other person tips the pot upside down and hits the bottom.. You might also find it helpful to jostle the pot back and forth until the plant comes loose.
If you still have difficulties removing your plant with two sets of hands, you can run a trowel or knife around the interior of the pot and try releasing it again, or push some of the soil out through the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot. If your plant still does not come out of the pot, you may need to break your pot, but this is a last resort.
While releasing the Aloe Vera plant from its pot, be sure that you are keeping the plant itself as steady as possible. All the movement should be centered on the pot, not the plant itself. In other words, hold, don’t pull, the plant. Hitting the bottom of the pot will keep your roots intact, and gravity will push the plant downward.Tend the roots. Examine the roots and determine how many of the roots are still healthy. Mushy roots are characteristic of root rot and need to be removed. Any roots that aren’t black or mushy are good and can be kept.
If you see a lot of healthy roots and only a section of dead or mushy roots, you can likely save your plant without too much trouble, but you’ll need to cut away the damaged roots. You can use a sharp, sterilized knife to cut away the dead roots, but make sure to get them all.
If you notice that the majority of your plant has damaged roots, it will take a little more effort to save the plant, and it may be beyond saving. In this case, you can try to save the plant by removing the largest leaves (with a knife). Cut away about half of the plant. This method is risky. However, with fewer leaves to nourish, the small amount of undamaged roots can better direct nutrients throughout the plant.Choose a pot that is one-third larger than the root system. Any excess soil will hold water and could cause root rot in the future, so a smaller pot is better than a larger one.
The roots of Aloe vera plants grow horizontally, rather than vertically.  Aloe vera plants can also become quite heavy, and the weight of the plant can cause a narrow pot to tip over. Thus, select a wide pot, rather than a deep or narrow pot.
The pot you choose should also have plenty of drainage holes on the bottom so that excess water does not sit in the soil.
A plastic pot is best if you live in a dryer climate, while a pot made from terra cotta or clay is best for cooler or humid areas.Use potting soil suitable for cactus or succulents. This type of soil has a higher sand content and produces a well-draining environment for your plant. You can find this type of soil easily at your local garden center. 
You can also create your own soil mix for your Aloe vera plant by mixing equal parts of sand, gravel or pumice, and soil. Be sure to use a coarse sand (like builder’s sand), rather than a fine sand. Fine sand can clump and hold water, rather than allowing it to drain down and through the pot.
Although you can use potting soil for Aloe vera plants, they will thrive better in a mixed soil. Potting soil is more likely to hold moisture and could therefore cause root rot.Replant your Aloe vera. Prepare the pot by filling it with the potting soil mixture, and shake your Aloe vera plant gently to remove about a third of the soil that has attached itself to the root ball. Place your plant in the newly prepared pot and cover the top with more of the potting soil mixture. Be sure that the entire root ball is covered with the soil mixture , but don't bury the plant deeper than it was in the first pot. 
You can also layer small rocks or gravel on the top of the soil, which helps reduce the evaporation of water.Do not water immediately after repotting. Your Aloe vera plant needs a few days to readjust to its new pot and to repair any broken roots.Check the soil. You can tell if your Aloe vera plant needs to be watered by pressing your index finger a few inches down into the soil. If the soil is dry, your plant needs water. Aloe vera plants are succulents and do not need to be watered often. Overwatering can kill your plant! 
If you keep your plant outside, watering every two weeks should be sufficient.
If you keep your plant inside, water it every three to four weeks.Modify watering according to the season. Aloe vera plants need more water in the warmer months, but less in the cooler months. Water less often in Fall and Winter, especially if your plant lives in a cool space.Examine the leaves. As a succulent, Aloe vera plants store water in their leaves. If you notice the leaves are dropping or are becoming almost transparent, your plant likely needs water.
However, the same qualities can be a sign of root rot, caused by overwatering. Ask yourself when you watered your plant last. If you watered it recently, you should remove the plant from the pot and check for root rot.Water until the soil is just moist. Water should never sit on top of the surface of the soil, so water with a light hand. Continue to check your plant weekly or bi-weekly by testing the soil to see if it needs to be watered.Check the leaves. If the leaves of your Aloe vera plant are turning brown or red, your plant may be sunburned.Reposition your plant. Move your plant to a place where it receives indirect, rather than direct, sunlight.
If your plant is typically in a position to receive artificial light rather than sunlight, reposition the plant so that there is a greater distance between it and the light source. You can also try moving it outside so that it is getting some indirect natural light, rather than artificial light.Water your plant. Check the soil and determine if your plant needs to be watered. The soil is likely dry if your plant has been getting too much sunlight, since the water would be evaporating more quickly.Remove dead leaves. With a sharp, sterilized knife, cut the leaf away from the plant at the base. Any leaves that are dead take nutrients from other parts of the plant, so be sure to remove them so that the rest of your plant doesn’t suffer.Click the Chrome menu button ⋮.

This sanitizer closely emulates the commercial kind, without all the chemicals and without the bad smell. Hand sanitizer should not replace hand washing; just use it when you really need it. Here's what you'll need:
2/3 cup 99% rubbing alcohol (isopropyl alcohol) or 190-proof grain alcohol (Do not substitute other concentrations of alcohol.)
1/3 cup pure aloe vera gel (preferably without additives)
8 to 10 drops essential oil, such as lavender, clove, cinnamon, or peppermint
Mixing bowl
Spoon
Funnel
Plastic containerMix the alcohol and aloe vera gel in the bowl. Pour the ingredients into the bowl and use the spoon to mix them together well. The mixture should be completely smooth.
If you want the solution to be thicker, add another spoonful of aloe vera.
Or thin it out by adding another spoonful of alcohol.Add the essential oil. Add it one drop at a time, stirring as you go. After about 8 drops, smell the mixture to see whether you like the scent. If it seems strong enough, stop there. If you like a stronger scent, add a few more drops.
Use whatever scent you enjoy. Lavender, clove, cinnamon, peppermint, cinnamon, lemon, grapefruit and passion fruit all work well.Funnel the mixture into the container. Place the funnel over the mouth of the container and pour the hand sanitizer in. Fill it up, then screw on the lid until you're ready to use it.
A small squirt bottle works well if you want to carry the sanitizer with you throughout the day.
If you make too much for the bottle, save the leftover sanitizer in a jar with a tightly-fitted lid.Gather your ingredients. Some people prefer not to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer, since alcohol has a strong smell and can have a severe drying effect on skin. Witch-hazel based solutions are not effective against viruses and bacteria. Here's what you'll need:
1 cup pure aloe vera gel (preferably without additives)
1 1/2 teaspoons witch hazel
30 drops tea tree oil
5 drops essential oil, such as lavender or peppermint
Mixing bowl
Spoon
Funnel
Plastic containerStir together the aloe vera gel, tea tree oil and witch hazel. If the mixture seems too thin, add another spoonful of aloe vera to thicken it. If it's too thick, add another spoonful of witch hazel.Stir in the essential oil. Since the smell of the tea tree oil is already strong, go easy on the added essential oils. Five or so drops should be enough, but if you want to add more, stir it in one drop at a time.Funnel the mixture into the container. Place the funnel over the mouth of the container and pour the hand cleaning solution in. Fill it up, then screw on the lid until you're ready to use it.
A small squirt bottle works well if you want to carry the solution with you throughout the day.
If you make too much for the bottle, save the leftover solution in a jar with a tightly-fitted lid.Use a milk jug. Fill a clean, plastic gallon jug with water, sand, rocks, or concrete. Make sure that the jug has a handle; you will use this to complete your exercise reps. Use the handles to lift and lower the jug like you would any hand weight or dumbbell.
With milk jug hand weights, you can do bicep curls, tricep exercises, bent-over rows, pec flyes, deadlifts, and shoulder raises.
You can also hold these weights to your sides when you are doing squats or lunges.

Laila Ajani			Fitness Trainer				Our Expert Agrees: If you don't have weights, try using a gallon jug filled with liquid, then hold that while you're doing squats or rows.Lift canned goods. Canned goods that fit into your hands work well as simple hand weights. This is especially good if you are starting out and trying to build muscles slowly. Use larger canned goods as heavier weights or medicine balls.Make dumbbells from plastic water bottles. Instead of recycling your plastic water and soda bottles, refill them with water, or put pebbles or sand in them instead. When filling them, make sure to weigh them so the weights are the same for both hands. Lift the bottles like you would any dumbbell.Make arm weights with water bottles. Instead of using the water bottles for hand weights, this method attaches multiple bottles to your arms like wrist weights. Before you put them on your arms, fill them with sand. For heavier weights, add water after you fill them completely with sand.
When they are filled, scotch tape the plastic bottles all the way around your forearm. The tape does not touch your skin; it only touches the bottles to hold them together. You can also use duct tape, just don't attach it to your skin. Place the bottles just tight enough so they do not slide off your arms.Make a weighted medicine ball from a basketball. Take an old basketball and drill a hole into one of the black stripes. The hole should be big enough to funnel in the weighted material. Place a funnel in the hole and fill with sand or pebbles until you have achieved the desired weight. Use a bike tire patch kit to fill the hole. You can also use duct tape if you don't have a tire patch kit. The repurposed ball can now be used just like a medicine ball.Make wrist weights from socks. Fill a clean sock with dry beans. Alternately, use pebbles or small craft rocks for a heavier weight. Sew or glue the open end of the sock closed. Then, sew the ends together, or sew Velcro onto the ends so you can remove it easily.
Use a scale to adjust the weight. Fill the sock as full as you want based on weight and then cut the excess fabric. If you want to make heavier weights but the inside material won't fit, use a larger sock.
When choosing a sock, make sure to choose one long enough to wrap around your wrist. If the sock is too long, fill it until it will wrap around your wrist, then cut the excess fabric before closing the end.Use packets of rice or beans. These packages are great for mini-weights if you are a beginner. You can use them right from the cabinet for bicep curls and other small weight-lifting moves.Cut bicycle tire tubes into hand weights. Take a bicycle inner tube and cut it into equal lengths. Secure one end of the tube with duct tape, then fill the tube with sand. Close the other end with duct tape. You can either leave them flat or bend them into circles until the two ends are touching and secure the ends together with duct tape.
This is a great method for making weights of different sizes. Start with 1 or 3 pounds. You can also try 5 or even 8 pound weights. Use a scale to weight out the weights before you close them.Make a weighted vest. Get a fishing vest or a vest with multiple small pockets. Fill plastic bags with sand or concrete and place in all the pockets. Run, do pull ups, push ups, or go walking while wearing the weighted vest.Use paint cans. Hold paint cans in your hands by their handles. Most paint cans are a little heavier than plastic bottles or cans of food, so you can use them as you build muscle. The handles allow you to use the cans like dumbbells.Use 5 gallon (18.9 L) buckets. Fill a 5 gallon (18.9 L) bucket with sand, rocks, concrete, or even water.  Use it to do curls or attach two of them to a bar or board and use as a bench press.Make a barbell with water bottles. Take 2 packs of 6 bottles each and duct tape them symmetrically to an iron bar you can grip easily. This barbell will be good for any exercise you do with a barbell, like lifts and presses.
If these 2 packs are too much, don't use half filled bottles. Half-filled bottles will slosh around and shake the bar. Instead, tape individual filled bottles to the bar.
If 2 packs aren't enough, use four or six packs of bottles taped to the bar. Alternately, tape individual bottles to each end of the bar. First line them horizontally along the bar side by side, then stack them on top of each other. Make sure to leave plenty of room for your hands to grip the bar in wide and narrow grips.
The taping must be functional. Make horizontal, vertical, and diagonal rounds to wrap the packs to the bar.Find old tires lying around the yard. Tires are used in many workout and bodybuilding routines. You can add additional weights to regular tires when doing workouts, or you can go to a junkyard and find tractor tires. Flipping them and tying a rope to them to pull behind you are only two ways you can use a tire as a weight.Build a slosh tube. Slosh tubes are long plastic tubes filled with about 40 pounds of water. But the workout benefits come from the uneven, sloshing water, which makes you use muscles as you try to keep the water balanced as it goes from one end of the tube to the other. You can make your own slosh tube with a PVC pipe. The pipe should be about 4 inches in diameter and 9-10 feet long. Place a cap on one end, then fill the pipe halfway with water. Cap the other end.Use a duffle bag to make a sandbag. Sandbags are similar to slosh tubes in that they are unstable, shifting weights that require you to engage more muscles. To make an easy sandbag, fill 5 or 6 gallon freezer bags with sand. You want the sandbag to be around 50 or 60 pounds. Double bag the bags so they don't break, and then tape the end. Place the bags into the duffle bag. Zip up the duffle bag, and you are ready to work out!
An alternate way to make a sandbag is to use an old army/navy rucksack or canvas laundry bag. Use contractor garbage bags to fill with pea gravel. You can fill them with 10, 20, or 25 pounds. Fill 5 or 6 bags with gravel, and secure them with duct tape. Add them to the bag until your desired weight.
Add and remove bags of sand or gravel for different weights. Use a scale to determine how heavy the bag is before you start working out, and add or remove weight accordingly. If you don't want to change the weight, you can add the sand or gravel directly into the bag. You cannot easily remove the weight or add weight if you do this.
Make sure to leave some room in the interior bags so the sand or gravel can move around.
If you are adding a large amount of weight, use a sturdier duffle bag.Use a milk or juice jug. Fill a clean, plastic gallon jug or 2 liter (0.5 US gal) bottle with water or sand. Make sure that the jug has a handle; this is needed to complete kettlebell exercises.Use old paint cans as kettlebells. Since old paint cans are meant to withstand being swung around, they can make great improvised kettlebells. Simply repurpose your paint can dumbbells to use in kettlebell exercises.Make a kettlebell out of a potato sack. Purchase a potato, rice, or sugar shipping sack, which can be found at most grocery stores. Fill the sack with sand until you have reached the desired weight. At the top of the sack, tie a loop for your hand. Use rope or duct tape to secure the loop so it doesn't detach. You can reinforce the sides and bottom of the bag with duct tape.
You can use this method to make multiple kettlebells of different weights. Use a scale to measure out how many pounds you are putting into the sacks before tying the top of the sack.Bring 1 cup of water (250 ml) to a boil. Once you have achieved this, remove water from the heat.Stir 15 grams (1/2 ounce) of malt extract into the water until it is completely dissolved. Bring it to a boil for another 10-15 minutes. This will ensure sterility.
This second boil is sanitizing the medium mixture, which is called “wort.”Add a packet of gelatin to the wort. Stir it until it is dissolved -- completely dissolved.Pour some of the gelatin-wort mixture into each of the jars or dishes you’re using to make your cultures. Fill each container about 1/4 inch full. It's easiest to do this with a sterilized funnel if you're using a test tube or vials.
Keep one empty jar or dish aside for use later in the culturing process.Place the jars or dishes in the bottom of the large stock pot. Make sure it has a lid! This is where having vessels with a flat bottom comes in handy. If you're using tubes with a rounded base, you'll need to rack them to stand them up.Add 2 to 3 inches (5 - 7.5 cm) of water to the dish. Or enough so that the water comes halfway up the sides of your culturing vessels. Make sure the water does not get inside the jars.
Add the jar lids carefully. Don't put them on, just in -- this will sterilize them. If you put them on, everything may explode.Bring the water in the stock pot to a boil. Keep it on high for 15 minutes to sterilize the culturing vessels. Then remove vessels from the hot water using your kitchen tongs and cool completely. This may take a while, so be patient.
You need to wait for things to cool to at least 40 deg. C before attaching the sterile caps, otherwise the cooling growth-medium will cause the vials to either suck the caps into the vials, or actually implode. Once cool enough, put the caps on the vials firmly. Pros generally cool for 24 hours at a slant.
These are often referred to as “slants” by home brewers because many use test tubes and invert them at an angle so the wort-gelatin mixture inside solidifies on a slant.Lay out your working area. You're now going to need a number of things. It'll be easiest if you have them all at your side when you begin this process. You'll need:
Yeast pack
Slant vials
An unwrapped paper clip or long needle
Cotton ball or folded up paper-towel
Your vial of ethyl alcohol
Your starter vessel laid out on clean paper toweling,
An empty, unused slant vial that has been sterilized, along with its cap.Prepare the yeast as directed on the package. Each package will list different tips and instructions, so follow them carefully. You'll need to shake the yeast so it swells and forms a paste.Start culturing your slants. Open the yeast packet about halfway. Wipe the needle or paper clip with the alcohol swab (this sterilizes the needle and removes contaminants that could prevent the yeast from culturing properly).
Draw a small amount of the yeast paste into the needle or swirl the paper clip around in the yeast packet to coat it.Insert the needle into the gelatin mixture and release the yeast. Work as quickly as possible during this step to prevent contamination. Avoid breathing if at all possible.
Some brewers recommend placing an alcohol-soaked paper towel over the opening of the jar or dish and inserting the needle or paper clip through it into the dish to help prevent contamination when inserting the yeast.Cap the jar or dish tightly. Place the jars in a clean, cool, dark place for 72 hours. Within a couple of days you will see a cloudy film on the slant surface, and a few days later it will develop into a milky white layer about 1 mm thick.
Wipe the outside of the jars and lids with alcohol swabs. As always, everything needs to be completely sterile.Loosen each jar slightly to release the pressure built up in each jar, then tighten again.
You'll notice a slight hissing sound as you break the seal on the jar. That's excess carbon dioxide from the yeast grows as it escapes to reduce the pressure in the jar.Label each jar with the date it was cultured. Store in a clean refrigerator to continue culture growth. They will keep in perfect condition for at least 3 months.Boil 1 medium potato in unsalted water until done. Drain, but save the water.Mash the potato. Add 1 teaspoon of sugar and and a pinch of salt.Cool to lukewarm. Add enough potato water to make one quart of mixture.Cover and set in a warm place. Allow to ferment.
Note: If the starter is not rising, you can add a package of store bought yeast to speed up the process––but––it will be just as good if allowed to ferment without the added yeast.Find 2 to 8 players.  Monopoly can be played with as few as 2 people up to 8 players at most. Each number of players brings its own advantages and drawbacks so it is important to know them before you decide on how many people are going to play.
2-person games are not recommended due to the nature and mechanics of the game. At the start of the game, both players will be evenly matched and find the game to last a long time. Once someone gets lucky or makes a great move, they usually win the game without a chance for their opponent to catch up. Do not let this deter you though if you only have two available players. It can still be very fun.
3-5 person games are great because of their balance between fairness and enjoyment. Games can last over two hours if players are evenly matched and when someone appears to be winning, there's a lot of room for the losing players to stay in the game.
6-8 person games are fun but can have a few problems. As only one person can win the game, more players means there will be more losers. Furthermore, there is a longer wait between turns, yet this isn't too much of an issue as Monopoly gives you a handful of options you can do when it's not your turn, until everyone wants to do an action at once.
Monopoly is intended to be played by people aged 8 or over. Younger players may not enjoy the game if they do not like to lose as the game requires some strategy to win. It is recommended to help new and young players by offering tips and opting for a more co-operative playstyle.Choose a banker. This player is in charge of all the money, property, houses, and hotels still belonging to the bank. The banker can still play the game, but they should make sure their own money is separate from the bank's. If it is easier, the banker can place the box where most players can reach, allowing people to help themselves to money, houses and properties, providing that they only do this when they're allowed to.Set up the board. Unfold the Monopoly board and lay it on a flat surface. Make sure each player has enough space to keep their money and property deeds in front of them. You should also lay out the Chance and Community Chest cards on the board. They are marked in the center.Pick a game piece. Each player gets a game piece to move around the board. The game comes with a large selection, but you can also play with any small object. It does not matter what piece you choose as they all serve the same purpose.Give each player $1500. Before the game starts, the banker gives everybody their starting money. It should add up to $1500. Most players like to keep their lined up in front of them, but you can store your money any way you want as long as it is in front of you. Players may also exchange money for different bills of the same value. For example, giving $500 to the bank in exchange for 5 $100s.
US Version | UK Version
2 $500s | 2 $500s
2 $100s | 4 $100s
2 $50s | 1 $50
6 $20s | 1 $20
5 $10s | 2 $10s
5 $5s | 1 $5
5 $1s | 5 $1sRoll the dice to pick the first player. Whoever rolls the highest number goes first, and play then continues clockwise around the board. You can use two dice or one, whichever you prefer. A quicker alternative is for the youngest or newest player to go first. This skips the initial dice rolling and gives them a small advantage. After the first turn, play goes to the player on the left in a clockwise fashion.Roll the dice and move your game piece. Each player rolls the dice and moves their game piece the same number of spaces. If you roll doubles, you get to move again after resolving the space you have landed on.Look at the space you landed on. Monopoly has many different kinds of spaces. Most of them are properties that you can buy or pay rent on, but some of them require you to draw a card from one of two decks, collect money, or even go to jail.Buy an unowned property when you land on it. If you are the first one to land on a spot with a colored stripe across the top, a railroad, or a utility, you may buy the property for the amount printed on the board. The banker in turn gives the player the title deed for that property. Most players recommend buying every property you can as if you don't, the other players have a chance to get it for cheaper.Auction any unsold property. If you land on an unowned property but choose not to buy it, then the property is auctioned and awarded to the highest bidder. This rule is part of the official game but many people omit it at home.
Whenever a player who lands on an unowned property opts not to buy it, the banker takes over and auctions it off immediately. The player who initially declined to buy the property at the printed price can still participate in the auction. Bids start at $1 and stop when no one wants to increase their bid. If absolutely no one wants the property, it returns to the bank and the game resumes.Collect rent. If you land on someone else's property, you must pay them the rent printed on the title deed card for that property (unless they have mortgaged the property). Rents vary according to the price of the property, whether or not a player has a complete color set (monopoly) and how many buildings have been built there.Buy all the properties in a colored group to get a monopoly. If you own all the properties in a colored group, you have a monopoly! This is one of the main goals of the game--you can bankrupt other players easily if you have a monopoly. Players with a monopoly get to charge double rent for their property on unimproved sites of that color set. The reason rent is so high when you have a monopoly is based on real life business as no competitors means no need to fight for the lower price.Build houses on your monopoly. If you have a monopoly, you can start to build houses on any of those properties to charge more rent. You can find the building prices on your property deed. You can build up to four houses on each property of your monopoly. 
Buildings raise the rent on your property significantly. For example, the first property on the board, Mediterranean Avenue, rents for $2 without any buildings. When you build four houses, you can charge $160 to each player who lands on it.
You have to build evenly--you can't build two houses on one property in your monopoly and none on the others. If you buy one building for a property, you can't put a second one on that property until you have bought a house for every property in your monopoly.Build a hotel after you've built four houses. The most lucrative buildings you can add to your properties are hotels. After you've built four houses on each property, you can buy a hotel from the bank and replace the houses with them. A hotel is roughly equivalent to having five houses yet the maximum number of houses on a site is four. However, it is sometimes better to leave the four houses on each property instead of building the hotel if you wish to create a house shortage for other players.Collect $200 when you pass GO. Every time a player lands on or passes over the corner space marked "GO," they earn a $200 salary. This is a great way to add a little cash to your reserves!
According to the official rules, you only get $200 for passing or landing on the GO square, but many people allow you to collect more whenever you land right on GO. This house rule should be avoided as it can prolong the game in the bad sense of the word.Take a Chance or Community Chest card. If you land on a spot marked "Chance" or "Community Chest," take the top card off of the corresponding deck of the space that you landed on. These cards have effects that can cause you to earn or lose money, move you across the track or even send you to jail. There's also the infamous "get out of jail free" card. When you're done reading the card, return it to the bottom of the corresponding deck.Go to jail. Going to jail prevents you from moving around the board until you're free.  But you still can collect rent, buy houses, participate in auctions, and trade with other players. There are three possible ways to go to jail:
Landing on the space marked "Go to Jail" is the most common way to end in jail.  The player goes diagonally across the board to the jail space without passing GO, and their turn ends immediately.
If you pick a Chance or Community Chest card that reads this, your turn ends immediately and you must go directly to the space marked "In jail". If you pass GO on the way to jail, you don't get to collect your $200. Put your game piece inside the jail cell when you are sent to jail.
Rolling three consecutive doubles on the same turn also sends you to jail immediately. Place your token into the jail cell as soon as the third double is rolled.
If you just land on the jail space by an ordinary dice roll, you can place your token on the "Just Visiting" section of the square. You are not subject to any restrictions and can take your next turn as usual.
You can get out of jail by paying $50 bail, using a Get Out of Jail Free card, or rolling doubles on your next turn.  If you succeed in rolling a double to get out of jail, you move forward the given number of spaces but do not take another turn.  You must leave jail on your third turn and immediately pay $50 if you fail to roll doubles on that turn.Make deals with other players. Trading with other players is a key part of the strategy of any Monopoly game.  This is usually how you obtain a monopoly to build houses and hotels.   Many players also have house rules that allow them to grant rent immunity to another player, lend money to another player, or borrow from the bank without mortgaging property.
Do not include any house rules during your first game as including them can impact the enjoyment of the game and extend how long the game goes on for which isn't a good thing.Set a time limit to determine the winner (optional). If you want a faster game, try setting a timer for 1 or 2 hours. When the timer goes off, each player counts their total amount of money, the printed prices of all their unmortgaged properties, half the prices of all their mortgaged properties, and the printed prices of all houses and hotels.  The richest player wins the game!
If you do decide to play using a time limit, players' strategies can differ slightly. In a normal game of monopoly, the winner of the game could have a bad start and be very poor early on. You may want to declare the winner not to be the richest player but the one who made the best decisions, decided by your group democratically.Do NOT award money for landing on Free Parking. Many people use a variation of the rules to add more money to the game. Instead of putting tax money or other payments back in the bank, they put it in the center of the board and give it to anyone who lands on Free Parking. While it's fun to win a pile of money, it actually makes the game go on for much longer! A game of Monopoly should only take about two hours.Mortgage property. If you can't pay the rent when you land on a property, you can mortgage your property. You can also choose to mortgage a property to buy other properties, houses, or hotels.  When a property is mortgaged, no rent can be collected. To unmortgage it, you must pay 10% interest when you pay it off. If you have to pay a decimal, always round it up.
Mortgages have their rewards and their consequences. You should only mortgage a property to avoid bankruptcy or to make a quick boost of money for buying more properties and trading. You can also sell your mortgaged properties to other players, causing them to pay the bank if they want to collect rent on that property. The 10% interest is far better than the 50% loss from selling buildings.Go bankrupt. If you owe more money than you and your assets can afford, you're declared bankrupt and are out of the game. In official rules, your money and properties are given to the player who caused you to become bankrupt after selling all the buildings first. However, this can cause a winning player to win even more. It is recommended that when a player becomes bankrupt, all of their property is auctioned off as this makes the game a bit more balanced for the remaining players.Fill a 5-gallon (18.927 L) stainless steel pot about halfway full with tap water.Place a glass bowl in the water. Be sure it floats. The bowl should not touch the bottom of the pot.
If the bowl doesn't float, remove it from the water and set a round baking rack on the bottom of the pot. Then place the bowl back in the waterThe water in the pot must be boiling before going to the next step. This is to boil off chemicals such as methanol and ethanol.Create a condensation effect with a hot/cold barrier. You can do this by inverting the pot's lid and filling it with ice. When hot steam hits the cold lid, it will create condensation.Boil the water in your pot. As the water continues to boil, it will cause steam to rise and condense on the pot's lid. The condensation will drip into the bowl. Allow the distillation process to continue until you have enough distilled water in the bowl for your needs.Watch the water collecting in the bowl. This bowl water will be hot but should not boil. If the bowl water begins to boil, turn down the heat on the stove so that just the pot water is boiling.Remove your pot from the heat and take off the lid.Take the bowl of distilled water out of the pot of boiling water. Use caution when doing this so you do not burn yourself. You can allow the water to cool before removing the bowl, if you prefer.Allow the distilled water to cool before storing it.Get 2 glass bottles for making distilled water. This process works best if at least 1 of the bottles curves outward from the neck, preventing the distilled water from sliding back into the other bottle.Fill 1 bottle with tap water. Stop filling about 5 in (12.7 cm) from the top.Join the 2 bottles together at the neck and secure them tightly with duct tape.Use a 5-gallon (18.927 L) stainless steel pot of boiling water to distill the water. You want just enough water to cover the bottle filled with tap water.Tilt the bottles at about a 30-degree angle, leaning the top, empty bottle on the inside of the pot's rim. The angle makes it easier to collect the evaporated distilled water.Rest an ice pack or a bag of ice on top of the bottle on top. This will create a hot/cold barrier, causing the evaporation of water in the filled bottle to condense into the cooler bottle.Continue the distillation process until you collect enough distilled water in the bottle for your needs.Put a large, clean container outside to catch the rainwater.Leave the container outside for 2 full days to allow the minerals to dissipate.Store the distilled water in clean jugs. Note: While this method can produce drinkable water, it's possible for pollutants and harmful bacteria to remain in the water.  It's always safest to filter, boil, or chemically treat rainwater before drinking, unless you know it's safe otherwise.Eat healthy fats. Many dieters believe that they need to avoid fat like the plague when trying to lose weight. However, eating a certain amount of healthy fat is essential for a balanced diet and can actually aid weight loss. In fact, studies suggest that a diet with a higher ratio of monounsaturated fats (MUFAs) (avocados, nuts, seeds, soybeans, chocolate) can prevent the accumulation of belly fat. As a result, 25 to 30% of your daily calorie intake should come from such healthy fats.
Polyunsaturated fats - such as the Omega-3 fatty acids found in mackerel, salmon, herring, walnuts, canola oil and tofu - are another type of healthy fat that you should try to incorporate into your diet. They help to lower bad cholesterol and boost brain function.
Trans fats, on the other hand, (found in margarine, crackers, cookies--anything made with partially hydrogenated oils) result in more fat being deposited in the abdomen, so you should avoid these as much as you can.Eat smaller, more frequent meals. It is very common for dieters to try to starve themselves between meals, with the result that they actually eat much more than necessary when the food is finally in front of them. One of the best kept secrets of successful dieters is that they actually eat more frequently throughout the day, they just eat smaller meals.Note: Eating smaller, more frequent meals prevents dieters from becoming too hungry, causing them to eat less overall. It also stimulates the metabolism, which allows the body to burn more calories throughout the day.

Try eating six small meals a day, rather than your regular three large ones. You'll find sticking to your weight-loss plan much easier in the long-run if you're not in a constant state of hunger!Start the day with a healthy breakfast. Kicking off the day with a healthy, balanced breakfast is one of the best things you can do when following a weight-loss diet. A good breakfast kick starts the metabolism, allowing you to burn more calories throughout the day. It also keeps you fuller for longer, reducing your tendency to snack throughout the morning and afternoon, which may result in a higher calorie intake overall.
Try eating a combination of filling wholegrain cereals and breads, protein-rich eggs and high-vitamin fruits for the perfect balanced breakfast. If you're on the go, grab a fruit smoothie and a cereal bar for convenient, yet filling goodness.
You should also try to drink a glass of water before breakfast (and every other meal throughout the day) as this prevents your body from confusing thirst with hunger, which may lead to you eating more than you need. Plus it helps to keep you hydrated, which is always important.Get more fiber in your diet. Fiber-rich foods are an essential component of any healthy diet, for a number of reasons. Firstly, fiber-rich foods help to normalize bowel movements, which minimizes bloating and blockages. Secondly, fiber-rich foods help you to stay fuller longer and may require additional chewing time, thus preventing overeating. High-fiber foods also tend to be lower in calories than other food types.
Try to incorporate a wide range of high-fiber foods into your diet, to get the benefits of both soluble and insoluble fibers. Examples of soluble fibers include oats and barley, peas and beans, apples, carrots and citrus fruits. Examples of insoluble fibers include wheat bran and products containing whole-wheat flour, nuts, beans and green vegetables.
Soluble fiber, in particular, has also been shown to lower insulin levels, which can speed up the burning of visceral belly fat.
Plain water is the best alternative, as it flushes out your system, reduces bloating and keeps the body hydrated. However, if you find plain old water too boring, try drinking water with a hint of flavoring like mint leaves, lemon, lime, or even toss in a few frozen raspberries or create a combination- Be creative! Vitamin water, or naturally sweetened iced teas also make a significantly healthier alternative to sodas.
Don't use straws. You should also avoid using straws to sip your drinks, as straws cause you to suck more air into your stomach as you drink, leading to bloating and a bigger belly. Drink straight from the cup instead to avoid bloating.Avoid processed foods. Even if you are carefully monitoring your portion sizes and consistently working out, your weight loss can be significantly impaired by a continued consumption of processed foods. This is because processed foods typically have high sugar and starch contents, which limit weight loss and lead to the buildup of harmful toxins.
Be extra careful when it comes to products that are marked "non-fat", such as cheeses, breads, yogurts, etc. These products may have a low fat content, but they are usually packed with extra sugar and empty carbohydrates, and offer very little, if any, nutritional value. Some frozen processed organic meals are actually not too bad, as long as you make sure to carefully read all the labels and check the content and ingredients list.
You should also avoid processed food products with a high salt content, such as ready-meals and frozen goods, as the salt leads to water retention and causes bloating. Just go for fresh foods instead of pre-packaged or frozen whenever possible.Be prepared to change your diet. Getting a smaller waist will require weight loss, which cannot be achieved through exercise alone. You will also need to adhere to a healthy diet and reduce your calorie intake in order to really see results. You should find a trainer to help you calculate a proper amount of calorie intake a day. This will require discipline and determination. In addition to reducing your calorie intake, there are also some smart food choices you can make that will specifically help to reduce your waistline.
For example, in a scientific study, people who ate all whole grains (in addition to five servings of fruits and vegetables, three servings of low-fat dairy, and two servings of lean meat, fish, or poultry) lost more belly fat than another group that ate the same diet, but with all refined grains. Remember that fruits have sugar, so exceeding your intake of fruits per day will impede your progress.
Keep in mind that in order to lose a pound of weight, you will need to cut 3500 calories from your diet. Health specialists advise that the optimal level of healthy weight loss is one to two pounds a week, so it is not recommended that you starve yourself or follow fad diets in order to lose weight more quickly.

Laila Ajani			Fitness Trainer				Our Expert Agrees: Exercise can help you be motivated to eat properly, but on its own, it won't give you a smaller waist, even if you're doing stomach crunches and cardio. Most people have to pay attention to their diets to get a smaller waist.Commit to an exercise routine. If you really want to trim your waist, you will need to commit to a regular and rigorous exercise routine. Great results will only come with hard work and dedication, so make sure you are prepared to put in the necessary effort before you begin. On the other hand, if you begin exercising too rigorously from the get-go, you may become disheartened and disillusioned, and therefore much more inclined to give up.
Tip: To overcome this, try making an exercise plan where you start at a reasonable level, before gradually building yourself up to longer more intense exercise routines. Keep a log of what you're doing each time in a record book or diary and check your progress against this.
Eventually you'll find yourself exercising regularly without feeling worn out or disinterested in it and your waist, along with your overall health and fitness, will have benefited a great deal.Do plenty of cardio. As mentioned before, weight loss is essential when it comes to losing inches from your waist. Unfortunately, there is no way to target weight loss in a specific area of your body, so overall weight loss is the only option. Cardiovascular exercise is the best form of exercise for burning calories, so it is essential to any weight loss routine.
Running, skipping and cycling are all excellent cardio options, which usually don't even require a gym membership. Cheap, yet extremely effective, there's no excuse not to incorporate a little cardio into your workout.
Trainers advocate tracking your heart rate during cardio. For example, the best way to shed fat is by walking on the trail or outside and keeping your heart rate at low-medium level. Have that after a session of endurance training and you are on the way to shed this fat.
You should do at least 150 minutes of moderate or 75 minutes of vigorous cardio each week. You can even do a blend of moderate and vigorous activity. To reach this goal, aim for 30 minutes of cardio exercise four to five times a week.Make sure you work out the correct core muscles. Many core strength-building exercises focus on the oblique muscles, which run along the side of your stomach. Although working these muscles will give you a toned and flat stomach, it will also build up the muscle, making your waist appear wider than before. This is definitely not what you want when aiming for a tiny waist. To work your core and trim your waist you should focus on your transverse and rectus abdominals.
Note: Your transverse abdominals work as your body's natural corset and so with enough work in this area you can achieve a smaller waist. Pilates does a lot of work that focuses on the transverse abdominals and therefore can be a very effective method.
Remember to breathe when exercising core muscles. While it may seem obvious, many people forget in the concentration on getting the muscle action correct and then you leave your body tense and fragile. Instead, remember to breathe in and out, on the way up, on the way down, etc. If you can't work this out in a rhythm that works for you, consider joining yoga or Pilates for help.Do specific waist-shaping exercises. Even though you can't target weight loss on your waist, you can certainly perform certain exercises which tone and slim the muscles around the midsection.
Do the 'hundred' exercise. This is done by lying on your back and lifting your legs up to a 90 degree angle. Raise your shoulder blades off the floor with your arms reaching towards your feet. Begin by pumping your arms up and down, and repeat for 100 pumps. Breathe in through the nose for five pumps and out through the mouth for five pumps. As you get stronger, you can start to lower the legs closer to the ground until your legs are only a few inches above the floor. Remember to keep your upper torso lifted off the ground.
Suck in your stomach. Try to keep your stomach sucked in throughout the day, while sitting at your desk, in the car or at the grocery store. This works the stomach muscles, while simultaneously making you look slimmer. Over time, you won't even notice you're doing it!

Do sit ups. Lie down on the floor or a yoga mat, and bend your knees while keeping your feet flat on the ground. Cross your arms over your chest. Slowly raise your upper body towards your knees before lowering yourself back down again.  Work up to doing three sets of sit ups, with 10-20 repetitions in each set.
Do twist crunches. This requires you to lie on your back and bend your knees up while keeping your feet flat on the floor. Bring your fingers up to touch your ears and slowly contract your abdominal muscles, lifting your torso off the ground. When you're at the point of feeling you can't lift your body any further, contract your side muscles and turn gently to the left. Return your torso flat to the floor. Repeat on the right side. Build up to two or three sets of ten to fifteen repetitions each.

Do a plank. Get into the position for doing a push up. Rest on your forearms and keep your eyes to the floor at all times. Pull your stomach muscles in tight, imagining them touching your backbone. As you do this, your bottom should be down and your back straight. Aim to hold this position for about a minute.
Do the side plank. This exercise targets the "muffin top" region of the body. Lie down on a comfortable mat, on your right side. Rest on your right arm and extend your legs outward, placing your left foot on top of your right foot. In this position, slowly lift your pelvis up from the floor. Contract the muscles all around the lower torso, including the lower back and hips. Continue to bear weight on your right forearm and feet. Aim to hold this lift for around 10-15 seconds. Repeat three to five times for each side, or work up to holding the pose for 60 seconds.Build your chest and shoulders. Emphasizing upper curves can make the waist seem to shrink, so you should incorporate some shoulder and chest building exercises into your workout routine in order to give the illusion of a smaller waist. Some specific exercises include:
Bench dips. This exercise works the arms and shoulders and is performed using an exercise step or kitchen chair. To do a bench dip, sit up straight on the edge of the bench or chair, extending your legs in front of you. Firmly grip the edge of the bench or chair and slowly slide your body off the bench, lowering yourself towards the floor. Keep your back straight, and keep lowering until your arms form a 90 degree angle. Push your body back to the original starting position and repeat.

Push-ups. This classic exercise works the chest muscles. It can be done by propping your body up on your toes (for a more advanced version) or by balancing on your knees (for an easier version). To do it, place your hands palms-down on the floor, approximately shoulder width apart and raise yourself up, using just the strength in your arms, until both arms are fully extended. Slowly lower your body down again until your elbows form a 90-degree angle. Raise yourself back up into the extended arm position and repeat.Try something different. Exercise regimes can become repetitive and boring, making you less inclined to follow through with them. This is why it's important to shake things up from time to time and try something new, whether it's a new form of exercise, or simply incorporating a new prop. Here are some suggestions for shaking up your exercise regime that can also help to improve your waist reduction:
Use a hula-hoop. Your waist and hips will benefit from 10 minutes a day of hula-hooping, with the added bonus you get to behave like a kid again each day!
One way to get and keep your waist (and the rest of your body) looking great is to dance! You don't have to start up dance lessons, but turn on the radio or listen to your iPod and party around for about 20-30 minutes every day. Make sure you're moving all of your body. Dancing burns off lots of calories and it feels great when you're having fun, and you'll look and feel great!
Use dumbbells. Build shoulder muscles by lifting dumbbells out from your sides for resistance. Lift 10 times for each set, four sets a day. The broader your shoulders and outer thighs, the narrower your waist appears.
Consider doing yoga or Pilates; these are great activities for core abdominal muscle exercises and you can also be part of a group session which can be very motivating.
Make exercising comfortable; ensure that you have floor mats, breathable clothing, a water bottle, and other things that help increase your enjoyment of exercise. Music in the background can also add motivation.Wear waist-cinching belts. Draw attention to your waist by wearing belts that emphasize and nip in your middle. They can be wide, skinny, jeweled, braided -- whatever! Wear them over dresses, long tops and even winter coats to get an hourglass figure which gives the illusion of a smaller waist.Wear A-line dresses. A-line dresses are those which are tight at the hips, then flare out towards the hem, giving the illusion of a smaller waist. They are very flattering on almost every body shape, as they emphasize the waist, while skimming over any imperfections around the hips and thighs.Avoid low-rise jeans. Low-rise jeans can be very unflattering to anyone who carries even a little weight around their middle, as they create the dreaded "muffin top" effect. High waisted jeans are much more forgiving as they cover up any excess fat around the hips, and draw attention to the waist. Worn with a tucked-in shirt, these type of jeans can be very flattering indeed.Try wearing a body-shaping undergarments. Picking the right foundation garments can greatly reduce your waistline.
Try "shapewear". Most quality lingerie stores carry lines of undergarments that are designed to smooth and support your figure.
Corsets. Worn under gowns as a figure enhancing item of lingerie in centuries gone by, the corset has gained renewed popularity recently for providing an effortlessly sexy silhouette, whether under other clothes or on its own. Steel-boned corsets (not as painful as they sound - promise!) do the best job of cinching in your waist, and can actually permanently reduce the size of your waist with prolonged wear!Understand what a medical mask protects you from.  Medical or surgical masks are intended to cover both your mouth and nose.  They are designed with material that can block large-particle droplets, splashes, sprays and splatter — all of which may contain viruses or bacteria that may be harmful to you.
Note: Small-sized particles, however, may still be able to penetrate a medical mask.  And, because the medical mask isn’t sealed against your skin, particles are also able to penetrate those openings.Know the difference between a medical mask and an N95 respirator.  An N95 respirator is a device used by health practitioners to block 95% of very small particles.  Unlike medical masks, N95 respirators fit more securely on your face and against your skin, and are able to filter airborne particles.
While an N95 respirator can block 95% of very small particles — very small being considered 0.3 microns — there is still a 5% chance harmful particles can penetrate the respirator.
N95 respirators are not designed for use by children or by people who have facial hair.
Some N95 masks come with an exhalation valve that is designed to reduce condensation build-up inside the mask and allow the wearer to breathe easier.  These masks, however, should not be used in a situation where a sterile field is required as the exhalation valve allows unfiltered (and possibly contaminated) air to leave the mask.
In general, each type of N95 mask should come with detailed instructions from the manufacturer explaining how to put on and take off the mask.  In order to ensure proper protection for both you and your patients, these instructions — above all others — must be followed.  The Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) also requires that users are trained how to fit and use N95 respirators.Clean your hands.  Before touching a clean medical mask, wash your hands thoroughly with both soap and water.
Tip: Before you throw away your paper towel,  use it to open/close a door after you’ve washed your hands.
Once you’ve applied soap to your wet hands, you should rub your hands together to wash them for at least 20 seconds before rinsing them off.
Always use a clean paper towel to dry your hands, and then place that paper towel into a trash bin.Check the medical mask for defects. Once you’ve taken a new (unused) medical mask from the box, check it to ensure it doesn’t contain any defects, holes or tears in the material.  If the mask has defects, holes or tears, throw it away and select another new (unused) mask from the box.Orient the top of the mask properly.  In order for the mask to fit as close to your skin as possible, the top portion of the mask will have a bendable, but stiff, edge that can be moulded around your nose.  Ensure this bendable side is facing upwards before applying the mask to your face.Ensure the proper side of the mask faces outwards.  The inside of most medical masks are white in colour, while the outside has a colour of some sort.  Before applying the mask to your face, make sure the white side of the mask is facing towards your face.Place the mask on your face.  There are many types of medical masks available, each with different methods of attaching the mask to your head.

Ear Loops — Some masks have 2 ear loops on either side of the mask.  These loops are normally made of an elastic material so they can be stretched.  Pick up this type of mask by the loops, put 1 loop around one ear and then put the other loop around your other ear.

Ties or Straps — Some masks comes with pieces of fabric that are tied around the back of your head.  Most masks with ties come with upper and lower ties or straps.  Pick up the mask by the upper ties, place the ties around the back of your head and attach them together with a bow.

Bands — Some masks come with 2 elastic bands that are placed over and around the back of your head (as opposed to around your ears).  Hold the mask in front of your face, pull the top band over the top of your head and place it around the crown of your head.  Then pull the bottom band over the top of your head and place it at the base of your skull.Adjust the nose piece.  Now that the medical mask is in place on your head and face, use your index finger and thumb to pinch the bendable portion of the top edge of the mask around the bridge of your nose.Tie the lower band of the mask if needed.  If you’re using a mask with bands that tie on the top and bottom, you can now tie the bottom band around the base of your skull.  Because adjusting the bendable nose piece can impact the fit of the mask, it is best to wait until after the nose piece is in place before tying the bottom straps.
If you’ve already tied the bottom straps, you may need to re-tie them more tightly to get a snug fit.Fit the mask to your face and under your chin.  Once the mask is completely secured, adjust it to ensure it covers your face and mouth, and so the bottom edge is under your chin.

World Health Organization			Global Public Health Agency				Expert Warning: Masks are effective only when used in combination with frequent hand-cleaning with alcohol-based hand rub or soap and water.Clean your hands.  Depending on what you were doing with your hands before you remove your mask, you may need to wash your hands.  Or you may need to remove medical gloves, wash your hands, then remove the mask.Remove the mask carefully.  In general, remove the mask by only touching the edges, straps, loops, ties or bands.  Do not touch the front portion of the mask which may be contaminated.

Ear Loops — Use your hands to hold the ear loops and remove them from around each ear.

Ties/Straps — Use your hands to untie the bottom straps first, then untie the top straps.  Remove the mask while holding onto the top ties.

Bands — Use your hands to bring the bottom elastic band up and over your head, then use your hands to do the same with the top elastic band.  Remove the mask from your face while holding the top elastic band.Dispose of your mask safely.  Medical masks are designed to only be used once.  Therefore when you take the mask off, place it in the trash immediately.
In medical settings there is most likely a garbage bin specifically for biohazardous items like used masks and gloves.
In a non-medical setting where the mask could be contaminated, place the mask by itself inside a plastic bag.  Tie the plastic bag closed and then throw the plastic bag in the garbage bin.Wash your hands again.  Once you’ve disposed of the mask safely, wash your hands once more to ensure they’re clean and didn’t get contaminated by touching the dirty mask.Know what to expect from these recipes. There is no real substitute for sticky rice; it is a type of rice (like brown rice) and not a dish (like fried rice). The flavor and texture of these recipes will be different because you are using regular rice. Also, be aware that even if you cook regular rice so that it becomes mushier or stickier, it still may not be sticky enough for nigiri-style sushi.Consider some substitutes. Are you looking to make sticky rice out of regular rice because you cannot find it in a store? If you can't find sticky rice anywhere, try searching for "sweet rice," or "glutinous rice." They are the same thing.
Try using another short-grain rice or risotto rice. Both will have a stickier texture once cooked (compared to medium and long-grained rice). Short-grain rice is stickier than other types of rice once cooked because it has more starch in it.Do not rinse the rice before you cook it. Most people rinse rice for sanitary purposes, and to get rid of the starch dust. Starch is what causes rice to become sticky and clump together. If you cannot bear to eat rice without washing it, then rinse it once or twice—but don't rinse so much that the water runs clear. You still want some of that starch left.Consider letting the rice soak in a pot of water before you cook it. Some people find that letting the rice soak in water helps it become stickier in the end. Try soaking it for 30 minutes to 4 hours. Drain the water once the rice has finished soaking.Fill a large pot with 2 cups (450 milliliters) of water and add a few extra tablespoons of water. Using more water than you actually need will help make the ricer stickier and clumpier.
Consider adding a dash of salt. This will give the rice some flavor and make it taste less bland.Add 1 ½ cups (300 grams) of short-grain rice or 1 cup (200 grams) of medium or long-grain rice. Try to use the short-grain rice variety, if you can. Short-grain rice tends to have a higher starch content than medium or long-grain rice, which makes it slightly more sticky.
Both jasmine and basmati are considered to be medium-grain.Bring the water to a boil over high heat. Do not cover the pot with a lid.Reduce the heat once the water is boiling, and let the rice simmer for 10 minutes. At this point, you can place the lid on the pot.Turn the heat off once the rice has absorbed all of the water. You may notice some steam holes in the rice.Leave the pot, covered, on the stove for 10 more minutes. Rice gets stickier the longer you let it sit. If you make it a day or two ahead of time, your rice will be extra sticky. If you do plan on waiting that long, however, you might want to cover the rice and leave it in the fridge so that it doesn't dry out or spoil.Serve the rice. Transfer the rice to a serving plate. If you want, you can fluff it a little bit with a fork to make it less clumpy.Know what to expect. You may be able to get regular rice to taste similar to sushi rice with the help of the right seasoning. However, it is very difficult to get regular rice to have the same sticky consistency as sushi rice. You may be able to use the rice from this method in sashimi, bento, and sushi rolls, but you may find it too difficult to mold for nigiri.Bring 2 cups (450 milliliters) of water to a boil in a large pot.Add 1 ½ cups (300 grams) of short-grain rice or 1 cup (200 grams) of medium-grain rice. Try to use the short-grain rice variety, if you can. Short-grain rice tends to have a higher starch content than medium or long-grain rice, which makes it slightly more sticky.
Both jasmine and basmati are considered to be medium-grain.Cover the pot with a lid and simmer for 15 minutes. The water will likely stop boiling for a few seconds when you add the rice. Wait for the water and rice start to boil again, then reduce the heat and cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid. Continue cooking the rice until all of the water is absorbed.Combine 4 tablespoons of rice vinegar, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and 1 teaspoon of salt in a small saucepan. Mix everything together with a spoon. This will be the seasoning for your sushi rice. It may also help your rice become a little more sticky.Bring the sushi rice seasoning to a boil over medium heat. Stir the seasoning with a fork or a small whisk until the sugar is dissolved.Remove the seasoning from the stove. Set it aside and let it cool.Transfer the rice to a glass bowl. During the next few steps, you want to avoid using anything made out of metal, or you will risk the vinegar picking up a metallic taste.Pour the seasoning over the rice. Do this while the rice is still hot. You don't have to use all of the seasoning if you want a less-intense flavor.Mix the rice and the seasoning together with a paddle. You can also use a spatula, but make sure that it is not made out of metal.
Consider working in front of a fan, or having someone wave a paper fan over the bowl. This will help the rice cool down faster.Serve the rice while it is still warm. Japanese sticky rice is best while it is still warm, but not hot.Fill a large pot with 2 cups (450 milliliters) of water and bring it to a boil.Add 1 ½ cups (300 grams) of short-grain rice or 1 cup (200 grams) of medium-grain rice. For best results, try to use a short-grain rice type. Short-grain rice tends to be starchier than medium or long-grain rice by nature, so it might give your better results.
Popular medium-grain rice varieties include jasmine and basmati.Cover the pot with a and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low. Be sure to keep an eye on your pot so that it doesn't boil over.In another pot, combine 1 ½ cups (337.50 milliliters) of coconut milk, 1 cup (225 grams) of white sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Stir everything together with a spoon to combine. You will be using this to season your rice.
To save time, consider doing this while the rice is cooking.Bring the coconut milk mixture to a boil over medium heat. Be sure to stir the mixture from time to time. This will prevent it from getting scorched.Stir the coconut milk mixture into the rice once the rice is done cooking. When the rice has finished cooking, take the rice pot off the stove and remove the cover. Pour the coconut milk mixture into the rice, and stir it using a fork or spatula.Set the seasoned rice aside for one hour. Put the cover back on the rice pot, and place the pot some place where it won't be disturbed. This will give the rice enough time to soak up the flavors from the coconut milk mixture.Combine ½ cup (112.50 milliliters) of coconut milk, 1 tablespoon of sugar, ¼ teaspoon of salt, and 1 tablespoon of tapioca starch in a saucepan. Stir everything together with a spoon. This will be your sauce. If you don't have any tapioca starch, you can also use cornstarch or arrowroot powder instead.Bring the sauce to a boil. Be sure to stir the sauce from time to time so that it doesn't curdle or scorch.Prepare the mango. Start by peeling the mango. If your mango is ripe enough, you should be able to nick the skin with your knife, then pull the skin off. Once you have the mango peeled, cut it in half and remove the seed. Cut the mango into thin slices. Repeat this step for the other two mangoes.Scoop the rice onto four plates. You can create more servings than just four, but the portions will be smaller.Arrange the mango slices. You can set them down right next to the rice, or on top of the rice. If you are placing the slices on top of the rice, to overlap them to create a fan-like shape.Drizzle the sauce over the mangoes and rice. If you want, you can also sprinkle some sesame seeds on top of the sauce.
Keep in mind that, because you are not using sticky rice, the texture may not be quite the same as in the traditional dish.Try a low fade on hair with more texture. If your client’s hair is thick or wavy, buzz the hair with the shortest clipper guard settings at a lower area, preferably below the ears and around the nape of the neck. Low fades show off a hair's texture better and work with the hair's natural pattern.
The longer the hair is on top, the lower the fade should be.Choose a high fade for more contrast. If you want a cleaner, more buzzed style on the back and sides, go with the lowest clipper guard settings moving up to the temples. Try a high fade for a sleeker look.
High fades work well with square or round face shapes because they lengthen the appearance of the face.Use a pair of clippers and styling scissors to cut a fade. Choose a pair of clippers with at least 3 guard lengths so you can blend the client’s hair as you go. Use clippers on the back, sides, and nape and styling scissors on the top.
If you prefer a softer fade, you can also use styling scissors on the back and sides. However, keep in mind that this is an advanced technique, so do not attempt it unless you are very experienced with fades.
Do not use household scissors to trim hair, as it can result in a blunt or uneven cut.
Keep in mind that you can use clippers near the top of your head too if you like it shorter than {[convert|1|in|cm|abbr=on}}.Wash and dry the hair before cutting it. Damp, clean hair is easier to work with while cutting fades. Wash the person's hair with shampoo, rinse it with water, and air or towel dry it until it is damp.
The hair should be somewhat damp, not dripping wet, to make cutting it simpler. The client’s hair should not be so wet that it clumps together or you may end up cutting out chunks of it.Trim the top with styling scissors. Lift sections of hair from the top of the head so that the tips of the hair protrude from between your forefinger and middle finger. Trim the tips of the hair with the scissors at your desired length.
Continue trimming the hair at the top of the head in sections until you've trimmed it to the same length.
If the person has bangs, trim the bangs in sections for a neat and even line.Trim the entire sides and back with a long guard size. Set the clippers to a long guard length, depending on how long you want the top of the fade, and buzz the entire back and sides. Continue trimming until each part of the hair is a uniform length.
Use a vertical movement to cut the hair starting at the hairline and up towards the top of the client’s head.
Work against the grain of the hair to achieve an even cut.
Lift the clippers up and outwards slightly at the end of each stroke as you get close to the rounded part of the person’s head to help the cuts fade together smoothly.Cut the back of the head with the next shortest guard. Switch to the next shortest guard and, beginning in the back, cut the hair in vertical strokes from the neck toward the crown. Stop just below the crown so that the hair on top of the head is left long.
If you were using a #3 guard size, for example, switch to a #2.
Blend any uneven lines that you notice by going back over them with the clippers.Buzz the nape with the shortest guard setting. Start at the nape of the neck and cut in upward strokes toward the back of the head's center. Work your around the head's back and sides, pulling back at the same height for an even finish.
Pull back with your clippers to blend the nape's short hair with the back's long hair.
Shave the hair from the nape and below to create a clean, neat edge.Clean the edges with your clippers. Move your clippers on the shortest guard setting along the nape and edges of the sides. If you find any poorly blended or uneven spots while you go, go back over them with the appropriate clipper guard. You should also turn the blade around and use it to go around the edges of the hairline. This will help to create a clean outline.Inspect the fade and brush off any hair clippings. Ask the client to look at their new cut and determine whether they would like a shorter or longer fade. Brush away any cut hair from the neck and collar before you move on to styling the hair
If the person wants a shorter cut, trim off small amounts at a time to avoid cutting off too much.Style the top with a hair styling product. Clay, wax, gel, and pomade all work well with faded hair. Work a small amount of styling product into the top, brushing or combing it as you do so to give it a clean, neat look.
Ask the client what products they normally use and, if possible, incorporate these items, so they can replicate the style themselves.Trim the fade every 4 to 6 weeks, as regular maintenance. To maintain the same hair length and fade, re-trim the cut approximately once every 4 to 6 weeks. Although fades grow out evenly, their style can change significantly as they grow out and require routine trims.
Use the same clipper guards and styling method that you did while initially cutting the hair.
